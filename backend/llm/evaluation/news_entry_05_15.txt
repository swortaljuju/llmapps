Title: Rubio meets Syrian counterpart in latest step towards normalizing relations
Description: <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Thursday in Antalya, Turkey with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, the State Department said. It's the first such meeting in 15 years.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>It's another step in normalizing relations between the countries after President Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/trump-meets-syria-president-sharaa" target="_blank">met President Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> and made the shocking pronouncement that the U.S. would <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/trump-syria-al-sharaa-meeting-saudi" target="_blank">lift its crippling sanctions</a> on the country.</p><hr><ul><li>The last meeting between top diplomats from the two countries took place in 2010, when then-Secretary Hillary Clinton met her Syrian counterpart Walid Muallem in New York. </li><li>The Syrian civil war began the next year, and the U.S. shunned the Assad regime.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> Rubio met his Syrian counterpart bilaterally and also held a trilateral meeting with Al-Shaibani and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.   </p><ul><li>Rubio told his Syrian counterpart the Trump administration would start the process of sanctions relief to stabilize Syria, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. </li><li>Bruce said Rubio told his Syrian counterpart that he welcomes "the Syrian government's calls for peace with Israel, efforts to end Iran's influence in Syria, commitment to ascertaining the fate of U.S. citizens missing or killed in Syria, and elimination of all chemical weapons."</li><li>Rubio stressed the Syrian government must protect the human rights of all Syrians regardless of ethnicity or religion.</li></ul><p><strong>State of play:</strong> The Treasury Department said on Thursday that it's working with the State Department and National Security Council to execute <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/trump-syria-iran-gaza-ukraine-diplomacy-saudi-trip" target="_blank">Trump's direction</a> to lift sanctions.</p><ul><li>"We look forward to implementing the necessary authorizations that would be critical to bringing new investment into Syria," Treasury said.</li><li>Rubio said Thursday that Trump is expected to issue presidential waivers removing some of the U.S. sanctions against Syria.  </li><li>Other sanctions on Syria would have to be repealed by Congress, which is likely to take longer.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> Ahead of the meeting in Antalya, Rubio spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/edan-alexander-release-secret-talks-bahbah" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> and briefed him on Trump's meeting with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia.</p><ul><li>The Trump administration didn't notify Israel in advance of Trump's decision to hold that meeting and lift sanctions on Syria, a source with knowledge said. </li><li>During his meeting with Trump last month, Netanyahu specifically asked the president not to lift the sanctions and expressed concern about the role Turkey — which wanted the sanctions lifted — plays in Syria, Israeli officials say. </li><li>Trump disregarded Netanyahu's concerns.

"If we don't build that together, who will?"</li></ul><p><strong>Case in point:</strong> In New Orleans, Rye says a young mother broke down at the registration table. She worked two jobs but still couldn't afford her electric bill — and showed up hoping the tour could help.</p><ul><li>"We're not just telling folks to vote while they starve," Rye told Axios.

"We want to grow something that feeds people now and teaches them how to grow for themselves going forward."</li></ul><p><strong>That means more</strong> than voter registration.

"But they may be losing benefits or unsure why policy changes are hurting them. The beauty of this tour is that it helps connect those dots — and those people."</li></ul><p><strong>Rye takes that further</strong>, pushing back on a <a href="https://medium.com/the-bad-influence/why-arent-black-people-protesting-f2f5e4b6a81f" target="_blank">growing narrative</a> that Black organizers and voters <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/12/missing-black-lives-matter-anti-trump-protests" target="_blank">have checked out</a>.  </p><ul><li>"We're not sitting this out.

Title: Supreme Court wrestles with limits on Trump's executive orders
Description: <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority on Thursday seemed to want to rein in the spate of lower-court rulings that have frozen parts of <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Trump</a>'s agenda, but struggled with the right way to do it.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>The justices heard oral arguments Thursday about whether to let Trump proceed with a plan to redefine <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment" target="_blank">birthright citizenship</a> in the U.S. or leave that policy frozen while the courts hash out whether it's legal.</p><hr><p><strong>Catch up quick: </strong>Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that aims to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/17/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court" target="_blank">eliminate birthright citizenship</a> for children who are born in the U.S. to parents who are not in the country legally.</p><ul><li>The policy rests on a novel legal theory that would upend a century-long understanding of the Constitution's 14th Amendment.</li><li>Multiple federal courts <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/05/trump-birthright-citizenship-federal-judge-injunction" target="_blank">blocked</a> Trump from implementing the new policy until the courts determine whether it's legal. Multiple appeals courts left those temporary freezes in place. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to lift them.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>The justices weren't debating whether Trump's policy is constitutional, but rather whether a single district court should be able to freeze an entire federal policy. </p><ul><li>Those courts' rulings should only apply to the specific parties before them, the Justice Department argued.</li><li>Solicitor General John Sauer told the justices that nationwide injunctions are a "bipartisan problem." Legal experts from both sides of the aisle have said they're <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/23/trump-boasberg-courts-constitutional-crisis" target="_blank">getting out of hand</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> Several of the court's conservative justices have expressed a desire to crack down on nationwide injunctions, but they wrestled Thursday with serious questions about the implications of letting Trump's citizenship order proceed.</p><ul><li>Liberal Justice Elena Kagan pressed Sauser on a hypothetical: What if the Supreme Court says lower courts cannot freeze the citizenship policy nationwide, but then ultimately rules that the policy is illegal?</li><li>In the time it took for the court to issue a final ruling, thousands of children would be denied citizenship, and would not be citizens of any country, she noted. And what if the Trump administration simply never asked the court to rule on the merits, she asked. In that case there would be no way to set a clear national standard for who's a citizen.</li></ul><p><strong>Chief Justice John Roberts,</strong> sometimes a swing vote on the court, seemed unmoved by those concerns. But they seemed to resonate with some other conservatives.</p><ul><li>Ultimately, Thursday's questioning didn't provide an especially clear picture of how the court is likely to rule.</li><li>That decision is expected by late June.</li></ul>

Description: <p>The Supreme Court said on Thursday that it will hear arguments next month over President <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment" target="_blank">Trump's efforts to restrict</a> birthright citizenship.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Trump's bid to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/trump-birthright-citizenship-judge-blocked" target="_blank">end the constitutionally guaranteed right</a> for some is the centerpiece of his administration's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/04/trump-immigration-strategy-homeland-security" target="_blank">sweeping immigration crackdown</a>, in which he's already <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/15/kilmar-abrego-garcia-deported-case-return" target="_blank">defied the Supreme Court</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>State of play: </strong>The nation's highest court said it would hear oral arguments over the case on May 15.</p><p><strong>Here's what to know:</strong></p><h2>What is birthright citizenship?</h2><p>Birthright citizenship, as outlined by the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/10/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-action" target="_blank">Constitution's 14th Amendment</a>, automatically confers citizenship to people born on U.S. soil – regardless of their parents' citizenship status.</p><ul><li>There are <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/birthright_citizenship_factsheet_241017.pdf" target="_blank">two types</a> in the U.S.: <em>jus sanguinis</em>, ancestry-based citizenship, and <em>jus soli</em>, birthplace-based citizenship.</li><li>In the former, which means "right of blood," children born abroad to at least one U.S. citizen parent <em>may be</em> entitled to U.S. citizenship, if they meet certain <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401" target="_blank">requirements</a>.</li><li><em>Jus soli</em>, on the other hand, is "the right of the soil" guaranteeing citizenship to almost everyone born in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Birthright citizenship was added to the Constitution in the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/" target="_blank">14th Amendment</a> after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship for formerly enslaved people who were newly freed.</p><ul><li>The right was <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/169us649" target="_blank">affirmed</a> by the Supreme Court in the 1890s, cementing birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens.</li></ul><h2>What is Trump trying to change?</h2><p>Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment" target="_blank">signed</a> an executive order on his first day in office this year, which seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents and undocumented immigrants.</p><h2>Has anyone fought these efforts?</h2><p>Trump's executive order was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/20/trump-birthright-citizenship-order-blocked-court-appeal" target="_blank">quickly met with legal challenges</a>, which resulted in temporary blocks on the order's enforcement.</p><ul><li>Last month, the president asked the Supreme Court to overturn those lower court orders.</li></ul><h2>How many people would be affected by the order?</h2><p>In 2018, there were 4.4 million U.S.-born children with at least one parent who is an "unauthorized immigrant," per a <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/mpi-unauthorized-immigrants-stablenumbers-changingorigins_final.pdf" target="_blank">Migration Policy Institute</a> analysis.</p><ul><li>Congress in 2022 defined unauthorized immigrants as "noncitizens who generally have entered the United States without inspection, overstayed a period of lawful admission, or violated the terms of their admission."</li><li>That figure represents most children living with parents who are unauthorized immigrants, 85%.</li></ul><h2>Has the number of children born to immigrants changed over the years?</h2><ul><li>In 2021, 21% of U.S. births were attributed to immigrant parents, the same share as in 2000, per child advocacy group <a href="https://datacenter.aecf.org/data/line/14-births-to-foreign-born-mothers?loc=1&amp;loct=1#1/any/false/2048,37,573,868,38,17,14,11/asc/any/272" target="_blank">Annie E.

Title: Scoop: U.S. presented Iran with nuclear deal proposal
Description: <p>The Trump administration gave Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal during the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/iran-usa-nuclear-deal-talks" target="_blank">fourth round of negotiations</a> on Sunday, a U.S. official and two other sources with direct knowledge tell Axios. </p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It was the first time since the nuclear talks started in early April that White House envoy <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/edan-alexander-release-secret-talks-bahbah" target="_blank">Steve Witkoff</a> presented a written proposal to the Iranians.</p><hr><ul><li>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took the proposal back to Tehran for consultations with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, President Masoud Pezeshkian and other top officials.</li><li>President <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> said Tuesday <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/trump-gulf-trip-saudi-uae-qatar-partners" target="_blank">in Saudi Arabia</a> that he'd presented "an olive branch" to the Iranians but stressed "this is not an offer that will last forever. The time is right now for them to choose."</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> During the first round of talks, Araghchi gave Witkoff a written document with several Iranian proposals. Witkoff told Araghchi it was too soon for that and he wanted to build rapport first, a source with knowledge of that meeting said.</p><ul><li>During the third round of talks in late April, Araghchi gave Witkoff an updated document with Iranian ideas for a nuclear deal. This time, Witkoff took the document.</li><li>A U.S. team of experts studied it and sent the Iranians a list of questions and requests for clarification. The Iranians replied and added questions of their own, two sources said.</li><li>Meanwhile, Witkoff and his team prepared a U.S. proposal laying out the Trump administration's parameters for an Iranian civilian nuclear program and requirements for monitoring and verification, the sources said. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> Witkoff and other officials have given contrasting answers as to whether and to what extent <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/04/trump-iran-nuclear-program-dismantled" target="_blank">Iran would be able to enrich uranium</a> under a deal, so it's significant that his team laid out the U.S. position in writing.</p><ul><li>A senior adviser to Khamenei <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iran-enriched-uranium-nuclear-deal-trump-rcna206833" target="_blank">told NBC News</a> Wednesday that Iran is prepared to sign a deal that allows it to enrich only to the lower levels needed for civilian uses and requires it to give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium — with inspectors verifying compliance — in exchange for lifting all sanctions.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes: </strong>Witkoff briefed the UN Security Council last Wednesday and described the U.S. proposal as "elegant" and "very big" but stressed more progress was needed in the negotiations, according to minutes of the meeting shared with Axios and confirmed by another source with knowledge.  </p><ul><li>Witkoff gave the proposal to Araghchi on Sunday in Oman, the sources said. A State Department official declined to comment. </li></ul><p><strong>State of play:</strong> Witkoff was encouraged by the results of the fourth round of talks, which took place a day before Trump set off on his Middle East trip. A fifth round hasn't been scheduled yet. </p><ul><li>"I hope you can help me with the Iran situation. It's a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing," Trump told Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim al-Thani when they met Wednesday.</li><li>Trump stressed he wants to avoid a war, "because things like that get started and they get out of control. I've seen it over and over again... we're not going to let that happen."</li></ul><p><strong>What's next:</strong> Senior diplomats from Iran and the E3 (France, U.K., Germany) are expected to meet in Istanbul of Friday for the first such meeting in two months. </p><ul><li>The three European powers have decided to trigger "snapback" sanctions under the 2015 nuclear deal if no new deal is reached by August, European diplomats say.   </li></ul>

Title: Biden officials "awed" by Trump's rule-breaking Middle East moves
Description: <p>President <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump's</a> recent series of audacious foreign policy moves have astounded even some of his harshest critics.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Just in the Middle East and just in the past week, Trump has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/trump-meets-syria-president-sharaa" target="_blank">met with a leader</a> the U.S. officially considers a terrorist, announced he'll lift all <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/trump-syria-al-sharaa-meeting-saudi" target="_blank">sanctions on Syria</a>, and cut a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/06/houthi-ceasefire-trump-yemen-attacks" target="_blank">truce with the Houthis</a> plus <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/edan-alexander-release-secret-talks-bahbah" target="_blank">a hostage deal with Hamas</a>, both of which excluded Israel.</p><hr><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> Biden administration veterans who spoke with Axios raised questions about Trump's motivations but grudgingly saluted his boldness.</p><ul><li>"Gosh, I wish I could work for an administration that could move that quickly," one admitted.</li><li>"He does all this, and it's kind of silence, it's met with a shrug," says Ned Price, a former senior State Department official under President Biden. "He has the ability to do things politically that previous presidents did not, because he has complete unquestioned authority over the Republican caucus."</li><li>"It's hard not to be simultaneously terrified at the thought of the damage he can cause with such power, and awed by his willingness to brazenly shatter so many harmful taboos," says Rob Malley, who held senior posts in three Democratic administrations, including handling <a href="https://www.axios.com/world/iran" target="_blank">Iran</a> talks under Presidents Obama and Biden.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>On issue after issue, Trump is taking steps no recent president would have even considered.</p><ul><li>He abandoned the unified Western position to back <a href="https://www.axios.com/world/axios-explains-ukraine" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> "as long as it takes" by negotiating directly with Vladimir Putin and declaring that Kyiv will never get Crimea back and must cut a deal now.</li><li>He inserted himself directly in the recent Kashmir crisis, something past administrations have avoided so as not to antagonize India.</li><li>He endorsed <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/iran-usa-nuclear-deal-talks" target="_blank">direct talks with Iran</a> and shrugged off hawks at home and abroad who tied the Obama and Biden administrations in knots. It helps that many of them, like Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, are loath to cross Trump.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> On Syria, Trump's own State Department had espoused a policy similar to the Biden administration's before it — sanctions relief might be possible if militant-turned-statesman Ahmed al-Sharaa's government met a number of criteria, such as suppressing extremist groups.</p><ul><li>That meant that, somewhat perversely, the new administration was being strangled by sanctions imposed on the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/08/syria-damascus-assad-regime-collapse" target="_blank">dictator they toppled</a>. But it was also just the way these things work, until Trump decided it wasn't. </li><li>"It's so clearly the right decision," said Ben Rhodes, a national security aide to President Obama, on the "Pod Save the World" podcast. "I don't know why Joe Biden didn't do this."</li><li>"I don't like Trump's motivations for lots of things he does," Rhodes continued, "but one thing you will say is he's not tied to this constant fear of some bad faith right-wing attacks or stupid Blob-type, 'we don't do this, we must leverage the sanctions for blah blah blah.' No! Sometimes you just have to try something different."</li></ul><p><strong>Perhaps most shocking</strong> to veterans of previous administrations, Trump authorized direct talks with Hamas last month that Israeli officials only learned about through espionage (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/us-hamas-talks-gaza-war-israel" target="_blank">or by reading Axios</a>).</p><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>This week, Trump's envoy-for-everything Steve Witkoff used backchannel talks to negotiate the release of Israeli-American hostage <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/12/hamas-releases-edan-alexander-last-living-american-hostage-in-gaza" target="_blank">Edan Alexander</a>, undercutting Israel's own negotiating tactics.</p><ul><li>"I suspect Witkoff doesn't have to look over his shoulder as much as others have. His predecessors have had to make sure the secretary of defense is on board and the secretary of the Treasury is on board, and the head of the CIA is on board. He just does it," the former Biden official said.</li></ul><p><strong>Flashback: </strong>The Biden administration considered but ultimately rejected opening direct talks with Hamas.</p><ul><li>"This is not about President Biden, this is about President Trump and the advantage that he has with Bibi [Netanyahu]," Price said. "If the Biden administration had done something like this, Bibi would have gone out guns blazing."</li><li>Now, even with the daylight between him and Trump growing more glaring, Netanyahu is keeping uncharacteristically quiet.</li></ul><p><strong>The flipside:</strong> Trump has also not pushed back hard as Netanyahu cut off all aid to Gaza, refused to budge in ceasefire negotiations, and announced a military <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/israel-gaza-destroy-trump-deal" target="_blank">operation to flatten and occupy the enclave</a>.</p><ul><li>Price argues that's the more nefarious side of Trump's a-la-carte "America First" approach. </li><li>"Unfortunately, we have a real-life experiment going on right now where we see exactly what happens when an administration abdicates that concerted pressure on the Israelis."</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>All the former Democratic officials who spoke to Axios questioned Trump's motives, even for policies they personally agreed with, noting that he's not just breaching norms to make peace, but also to sell cryptocurrency, expand his real estate portfolio or obtain a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/trump-qatar-air-force-one-presidential-gifts" target="_blank">$400 million jet</a>.</p><ul><li>The Syria announcement notably came at the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, two leaders fluent in Trump-style transactionalism. </li></ul>

                        <p><strong>Update, May 15, 2025:</strong> This story has been updated to reflect the FAA’s announcement late Thursday that it had approved Starship 9 launch, which came after publication.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">British officials told the U.S. they are concerned about the safety of SpaceX’s plans to fly its next Starship rocket over British territories in the Caribbean, where debris fell earlier this year after two of the company’s rockets exploded, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">The worries from the U.K. government, detailed in a letter to a top American diplomat on Wednesday, follow the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision last week to grant SpaceX’s request for a fivefold increase in the number of Starship launches allowed this year, from five to 25. Growing the number of launches of the most powerful rocket ever built is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-doge-faa-ast-regulation-spaceflight-trump">a priority for SpaceX head Elon Musk</a>, who is also one of President Donald Trump’s closest advisers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">Of particular concern to British officials is the public’s safety in the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands — all of which could face debris risk from Starship 9. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">After the explosion in January, residents of the Turks and Caicos reported finding pieces of the rocket on beaches and roads. A car was also damaged in the Starship 7 accident. Seven weeks later, after receiving the FAA’s blessing to proceed, SpaceX launched Starship 8 from Boca Chica, Texas, but it too exploded after liftoff. Air traffic in the region was diverted, and burning streaks from the falling rocket were visible in the sky from the Bahamas and Florida’s coast.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">The British letter to a U.S. State Department official, Ambassador Lisa Kenna, asks the U.S. to consider changing the launch site or trajectory of Starship 9. If that isn’t possible, the request — from Stephen Doughty, the United Kingdom’s minister of state for Europe, North America and U.K. Overseas Territories — asks that agencies like the FAA consider altering the launch’s timing to minimize safety risks and the economic impact for the British territories.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.5">The letter also requests that the U.S. government provide the United Kingdom more information on increased safety measures that will be put in place before Starship 9 launches, and that British territories be given enough warning to communicate with the public about those measures.  </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.6">“We have been working closely with US Government partners regarding Starship Flight 9 to protect the safety of the UK Overseas Territories and to ensure appropriate measures are in place,” a  UK government spokesperson said Thursday in response to ProPublica’s questions about the letter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The State Department did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">On Thursday afternoon, the FAA said it was “in close contact and collaboration with the United Kingdom and the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as other regional partners, as we continue to evaluate SpaceX’s license modification request for its proposed Starship Flight 9 launch.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Hours later, though, after this story originally published, the agency announced it had approved Starship 9’s launch, pending the completion of an investigation into the previous explosion. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">The agency also said it was expanding the "Aircraft Hazard Area" for the mission, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean, potentially affecting 175 flights. That hazard area nearly encompasses the Turks and Caicos Islands in their entirety, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/94821">according to the FAA’s environmental assessment</a>. The agency said the changes were due to the prior Starship’s problems and because SpaceX plans to reuse a previously launched Super Heavy booster rocket — something it will be doing for the first time.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">Turks and Caicos’ Providenciales International Airport will need to close during the duration of the launch window, the assessment said. Airspace over a portion of The Bahamas will be closed, too.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5">The FAA said the launch has been scheduled outside peak transit times to minimize disruptions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.6">SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. But the company has said it learns from its mistakes. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s flight will help us improve Starship’s reliability,” <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-8">the company said</a> after the Starship 8 accident. “We will conduct a thorough investigation, in coordination with the FAA, and implement corrective actions to make improvements on future Starship flight tests.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.7">Musk — who sees the uptick in launches as critical to the development of technology that could help land astronauts on the moon and ultimately Mars — has been less diplomatic. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.8">He downplayed the January explosion as “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spacexs-starship-blew-up-elon-musk-says-its-barely-a-bump-in-the-road-c7672ae3">barely a bump in the road</a>” and seemed to brush off safety concerns, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1880040599761596689?lang=en">posting a video of the flaming debris field</a> with the caption, “Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.9">SpaceX has not announced the date of the Starship 9 launch, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-test-fires-starship-for-an-all-important-next-flight/">news reports</a> have said it could happen as soon as May 21. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.10">The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which licenses launches and reentries, is undergoing a leadership shakeup. Three top executives, including the head of the office, announced in April that they were accepting voluntary separation offers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.11">Musk has been leading efforts to shrink the federal government through the departures of thousands of federal workers. Critics say he has an inherent conflict of interest because his businesses are regulated by agencies such as the FAA and rely on their approvals. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.12">Musk said in a February interview that “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304123/elon-musks-role-in-government-raises-conflict-of-interest-issues">I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict</a>.” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Thursday that “All administration officials will comply with conflict of interest requirements.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.13">Last year, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-633009-civil-penalties-against-spacex">the FAA proposed $633,000 in fines</a> against SpaceX for violations related to two previous launches. Musk, in turn, accused the FAA of engaging in “lawfare” and threatened to sue it for “regulatory overreach.” The administrative case remains open. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.14">The number of rocket launches has increased dramatically in recent years, leading pilots and academics to warn about a growing danger in the air for flights that have only minutes to get out of harm’s way when a mishap — as explosions and other failures are called in industry parlance — occurs. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.15">Researchers at the University of British Columbia found in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84001-2">study published in January</a> that the risk space objects pose to aircraft is rising. They said that the chance of an “uncontrolled reentry” from a rocket over a year is as high as 26% for some large, busy areas of airspace, such as those found in the northeastern U.S., in northern Europe or near major cities in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.16">A large union for airplane pilots told FAA officials in January that the Starship 7 breakup “raises additional concerns about whether the FAA is providing adequate separation of space operations from airline flights,” according to a letter sent the day after the rocket exploded.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.17">“The ability of the FAA Air Traffic Control to respond in a timely fashion to an unanticipated rocket anomaly needs to be further evaluated,” said the letter from the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 79,000 pilots at 42 U.S. and Canadian airlines. It asked that flight crews receive more information about high-risk areas before a launch so they can “make an informed and timely decision about their need to potentially reject flight plans that route their aircraft underneath space vehicle trajectories.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.18">In a response, the FAA said it would review its processes to see whether more can be done to prepare flight crews before a launch.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.19">Capt. Jason Ambrosi, the union’s president, said in a statement emailed to ProPublica that changes are necessary. “Any safety risk posed to commercial airline operations is unacceptable.”</p>
        
                                   

Title: Trump Administration Moves to Block the U.S. Travel of Mexican Politicians Who It Says Are Linked to the Drug Trade

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">In what could be a significant escalation of U.S. pressure on Mexico, the Trump administration has begun to impose travel restrictions and other sanctions on prominent Mexican politicians whom it believes are linked to drug corruption, U.S. officials said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1">So far, two Mexican political figures have acknowledged being banned from traveling to the United States. But U.S. officials said they expect more Mexicans to be targeted as the administration works through a list of several dozen political figures who have been identified by law enforcement and intelligence agencies as having ties to the drug trade.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">The list includes leaders of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s governing party, several state governors and political figures close to her predecessor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the U.S. officials said. They insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive policy plans.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">The governor of the Mexican state of Baja California, Marina del Pilar Ávila, confirmed that she and her husband, a former congressman, were told their U.S. visas were revoked because of “a situation” involving her husband. “The fact that the State Department has cancelled my visa does not mean that I have committed something bad,” she said at a news conference on Monday.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">Sheinbaum said her government had asked U.S. officials to explain why Ávila was stripped of her visa but had been told that such matters are private and no further information was given.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The visa actions represent the latest political challenge for the new Mexican leader and her leftist National Regeneration Movement, known as Morena. Despite the country’s historic sensitivity to any hint of U.S. meddling, Sheinbaum has thus far bolstered her support at home by asserting Mexico’s sovereignty in discussions with President Donald Trump while also moving to meet his demands for action against the biggest traffickers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Mexican journalists reported that U.S. immigration officials also pulled the visa of another border-state governor, Américo Villarreal of Tamaulipas, an assertion that the governor’s spokesperson dismissed as “unconfirmed.” (Villarreal has been frequently accused of having ties to drug trafficking, which he has denied.) Last month, the mayor of that state’s second-largest city, Matamoros, was stopped from crossing the border into Brownsville, Texas, but he, too, insisted he had not been formally stripped of his visa.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">A State Department spokesperson declined to comment, noting that visa records are confidential under U.S. law.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Three U.S. officials said the visa actions will likely in some cases be accompanied by Treasury Department sanctions that block individuals from conducting business with U.S. companies and freeze financial assets they have in the United States. Ávila said that she did not have any U.S. bank accounts and faced no such sanction.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the sanctions plan.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">When the administration imposed tariffs on Mexico in early March, it asserted that the country’s government had granted “safe havens for the cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of dangerous narcotics, which collectively have led to the overdose deaths of hundreds of thousands of American victims.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">As part of what it has described as an all-out fight against fentanyl and other illegal drugs, the administration has designated some of the biggest Mexican trafficking gangs as terrorist organizations and explored the possibility of unilateral U.S. military actions against them, officials said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.2">The review of Mexican drug corruption was initiated by a small White House team that requested information from law enforcement agencies and the U.S. intelligence community about Mexican political, government and military figures with criminal ties.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.3">Officials said the group has been shaping the administration’s security policy with Mexico under the leadership of a deputy White House homeland security adviser, Anthony Salisbury. It is overseen by the deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.  </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.4">A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment in response to questions about the group’s role in initiating the travel sanctions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.5">One official familiar with the team’s list said it overlaps with a file of about 35 Mexican officials that was compiled by Drug Enforcement Administration investigators in 2019, after López Obrador began shutting down Mexico’s cooperation with the United States in counterdrug programs.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">That earlier effort sought to identify Mexican government figures who could be criminally prosecuted for aiding drug traffickers. It led to the 2019 indictment in the U.S. of the country’s former security chief, Genaro García Luna, and his conviction on drug charges three years later in a New York federal court.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.1">The two former DEA officials in Mexico City who oversaw the compilation of the 2019 list, Terrance Cole and Matthew Donahue, also proposed that the State Department cancel the U.S. visas of some of the Mexican political figures named on it. Senior U.S. diplomats rejected that proposal.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.2">Cole is now awaiting Senate confirmation as the Trump administration’s new DEA administrator.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.3">Some current and former U.S. officials expressed concerns about the latest White House-led plan. They noted that the standard of proof required for both visa cancellations and Treasury sanctions is well below that of a criminal trial, which could encourage proponents of the measures to act on what might be less-than-solid information.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.4">Officials said the visa actions were being taken under Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which stipulates that noncitizens can be found ineligible for entry to the United States if the government “knows or has reason to believe” that the foreigner “is or has been a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator or colluder with others in the illicit trafficking” of illegal drugs. The law also allows the State Department to cancel the visas of relatives of a sanctioned official who may have benefited from their illicit gains.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">One U.S. official said that while the visa withdrawals might send a powerful signal of the United States’ new willingness to challenge Mexican corruption, they could also stir new conflict between the two governments.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.1">“We should be using all the resources of the government to go after these people,” the official said, referring to corrupt Mexican officials. “But the bigger question is: Does this work with President Sheinbaum? Are you going to lose an opportunity now with a Mexican government that has been very compliant on the drug front?”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.2">A former Mexican ambassador to Washington, Arturo Sarukhaan, said further visa actions against prominent figures in Sheinbaum’s party would make it hard for her to continue claiming a “good” relationship with the United States despite Trump’s often openly confrontational tone.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.3">“But at the same time,” Sarukhaan added, “it gives her — a nationalistic president with a very chauvinistic party behind her — a perfect excuse to say that everything bad that’s happening in Mexico with the economy and everything else is because of U.S. imperialism.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.4">López Obrador, who came to power in 2018, had promised to fight corruption as never before. Instead, he presided over an administration that denied having any corruption problem in its own ranks even as journalists produced report after report that officials close to the president and even his own sons were engaged in profiteering and graft.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.5">Sheinbaum has struck a different tone. In a message to a Morena party congress on May 4, she warned the faithful about the dangers of cronyism, nepotism and corruption.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.6">“All members of Morena should conduct themselves with honesty, humility and simplicity,” she said. “There cannot be any collusion with crime — whether organized or white collar.”</p>

Title:  GDP增长-0.2%！日本经济一年来首次萎缩 
Description:  <p>日本经济在过去一年首次萎缩，关税、通胀对日本经济造成双重打击。</p>
<p>据日本政府周五发布的初步数据显示，<strong>日本一季度实际GDP环比下降0.2%，这是一年来首次经济收缩，弱于经济学家预测的0.1%萎缩，</strong>也与前一季度0.6%的增长形成鲜明对比，一季度日本经济按年率计算萎缩0.7%。</p>
<p>这一GDP数据发布之际，市场正担忧美国关税可能通过抑制出口和降低企业投资意愿，危及日本来之不易的经济复苏。</p>
<p data-type="paragraph">凯投宏观亚太区主管Marcel Thieliant表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-type="paragraph">由于贸易战前夕经济已开始萎缩，日本央行可能要比我们预期等待更长时间才会恢复紧缩周期，日本央行7月份加息的难度越来越大。</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-type="paragraph">由于全球贸易前景的不确定性，日本央行最近将截至2026年3月财年的增长预期下调了一半。尽管日本央行仍在寻求进一步加息，但一些经济学家表示，如果贸易摩擦加深，央行今年可能无法采取任何行动。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="629c58b3">出口疲软与通胀双重打击</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>第一季度数据显示，外部需求（出口减去进口）削减了0.8个百分点的增长，其中出口下降0.6%，进口则增长2.9%。</strong></p>
<p><strong>随着美国关税损害作为日本主要增长引擎之一的出口，持续的通胀也在损害另一个引擎：私人消费（约占GDP的一半）。周五发布的数据显示，第一季度私人支出环比持平。</strong></p>
<p>&#34;持续的价格上涨通过削弱消费者信心，对日本经济构成下行风险，&#34;经济大臣Ryosei Akazawa周五在新闻发布会上表示。</p>
<p>Akazawa表示，关税担忧尚未影响消费，但这位负责与美国进行贸易谈判的部长承诺，在最近的政府调查显示消费者情绪可能恶化后，将密切关注消费者情绪。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="69ef8228">企业投资成为唯一亮点</h2>
</div>
<p>强劲的企业盈利推动公司增加投资并提供加薪。第一季度资本支出环比增长1.4%，这是数据中少有的亮点。</p>
<p>虽然较高的工资预计将有助于消费复苏，但食品通胀已经削弱了家庭的消费信心。</p>
<p>法国农业信贷银行经济学家Takuji Aida表示，日本央行需要确认日本经济在7-9月季度没有恶化，并在明年1月更新其预测，然后才能恢复加息。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="fd232b30">技术性衰退可能性加大</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>包括Aida在内的一些经济学家预计，日本经济本季度可能再次萎缩，使该国陷入技术性衰退（定义为连续两个季度的收缩）。</strong></p>
<p>虽然第一季度GDP的第二次估计可能会向上修正，使经济摆脱衰退危险区，但穆迪日本和前沿市场经济主管Stefan Angrick表示，任何升级都不太可能过分积极地扭曲前景。</p>
<p>&#34;即将到来的数据不会改变经济正在挣扎的图景，&#34;他在一份报告中表示。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="3d2a5542">美日贸易谈判成关键变量</h2>
</div>
<p>东京与华盛顿之间的谈判进展是另一个需要考虑的因素。</p>
<p>日本官员一直要求特朗普政府重新考虑关税，但能否达成协议尚不清楚。双方已同意在5月中旬或之后举行另一轮讨论。</p>
<p>到目前为止，&#34;2025年将是艰难的一年，因为关税痛苦和国内动力疲软威胁扼杀增长，&#34;Angrick表示。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，日本政府和央行陷入两难境地，继续加息可能进一步抑制经济增长，但不加息又可能导致日元继续贬值和通胀问题加剧。无论哪种选择，都将使日本家庭和投资者在短期内面临更大风险。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p>For decades, Americans have watched as federal involvement in education expanded, ballooning into a behemoth bureaucracy that imposes top-down mandates while divorcing parents from their rightful role as the primary educators of their children, while failing to achieve academic success for students.</p>

<p><strong>If we are serious about fixing our children’s education, we must restore parental authority and end federal control of education.</strong></p>

<p><strong>America’s Founding Fathers never intended for Washington, D.C., to dictate how children in Kansas or Kentucky learn to read, write, and think</strong>. Education was, and should be, a local and parental matter. President Donald Trump rightly stated in Executive Order 13985, <em>Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping</em>, “The experiment of controlling American education through federal programs and dollars…has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.” That failure is clearly documented by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often referred to as “The Nation’s Report Card.” Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, NAEP scores had <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard">stagnated or declined</a>. Today, nearly <strong>40% of fourth graders</strong> read <a href="https://nationsreportcard.gov/"><strong>below basic level</strong></a>, despite record federal funding. Billions of taxpayer dollars have produced declining literacy.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not just ineffective—it’s indefensible.</strong></p>

<p>Federal education initiatives have repeatedly promised results, especially for low-income students, but have failed to deliver. Programs like Title I and Head Start have cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the years with <a href="https://www.cato.org/">no consistent academic gains</a> to show for them. Similarly, federal control over college grants and loans has inflated tuition and <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/">buried young Americans</a> under a mountain of debt.</p>

<p><strong>The evidence is clear: centralized, bureaucratic control undermines education.</strong></p>

<p>As the founder of the “They’re YOUR Kids Foundation,” I work with parents every day who feel helpless. The system fails their children academically and often undermines their values. If we truly want to empower families, we must strip away the federal red tape and hand the reins back to those who know and love their children best: parents.</p>

<p>Representative Barry Moore of Alabama has proposed legislation (H.R. 2691, “Eliminate the Department of Education Act,” <a href="http://congress.gov/">Congress.gov</a>) to eliminate USED and redirect education funding based on what residents in each state pay in federal income taxes. But simply shifting USED’s functions to other agencies, as some proposals suggest, won’t solve the problem—it just moves the bureaucracy around.</p>

<p>That’s why I support the US Parents Involved in Education (USPIE) Blueprint: a five-step plan to close the U.S. Department of Education and return education governance to the states. The <a href="https://uspie.org/">Blueprint</a> is simple, sensible, and long overdue:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Return all program management and funding to the states.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Repeal laws like the <em>Every Student Succeeds Act</em> (ESSA) that enable federal overreach.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Privatize college loan programs through local financial institutions for increased accountability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Eliminate all divisions and spending within USED.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Reduce federal tax collection so states retain education funds directly.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p>We have a singular opportunity to implement meaningful change, including a federal tax credit system that empowers parents to direct their own children’s education. Under this proposal:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Parents who homeschool or choose private education would receive a <strong>Child Tax Credit</strong> equal to the federal per-pupil expenditure.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Federal taxpayers of households with children attending government schools would prompt their per-pupil allocation to be block-granted to their respective states.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>This model respects choice while avoiding the pitfalls of government entanglement. Voucher programs, while well-intentioned, often bring government regulation with them. The 1980 Supreme Court ruling involving Hillsdale College affirmed that any institution accepting federal funds—even indirectly through student aid—is subject to federal control. [Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984)] That’s the Trojan horse we must avoid.</p>

<p><strong>We must stop pretending we can reform federal education mandates and instead recognize them for what they are: unconstitutional, ineffective, and dangerous to parental rights.</strong></p>

<p>As a mother who homeschooled three children, I know firsthand the value of individualized learning guided by a parent who knows their child’s needs and aspirations. Education is not simply the memorization of facts or test preparation. It is the formation of character, virtue, curiosity, and conviction. That formation is best entrusted to families—not bureaucrats in Washington.</p>

<p>President Trump’s 2025 executive order declared that closing the Department of Education would “restore the proper role of families and local governments in education.” But that can only happen if we also change the funding structure and remove all federal strings. If not, we risk replacing one failed model with another, abandoning the nation’s most precious resource, and ultimately forfeiting our very future.</p>

<p>It’s time to reject the lie that Washington knows best. Parents are not the problem. They are the solution. Local communities, not federal mandates, are best equipped to nurture the next generation of citizens. And education must once again become the deeply personal, values-rooted family journey it was meant to be.</p>

<p><strong>We have a roadmap. We have legislation. And most importantly, we have an awakening of parents across this country who are saying, Enough is enough.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s seize this moment to make education truly free—by making it family-led.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/34469/share-of-respondents-with-food-intolerance/"><em>As Statista's Katharina Buchholz reports,</em></a> <strong>the figure was highest in the U.S. and lowest in France. </strong></p>

<p><strong>In four other countries surveyed - the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and China - between 10 and 11 percent said this was the case for them.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4274/global-health/">Food intolerances and allergies,</a> like insensitivity to gluten, dairy, sugar or more specific products, have been a hot topic over the last couple of years.</p>

<p>While awareness around food insensitivities has certainly risen and more people were able to get <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/799/health/">diagnoses</a> in the field, hyperconsiousness around food, health and fitness are also becoming more widespread - with both areas increasingly harder to distingush from one another.</p>

Title: New York To Send 'Inflation Refund' Checks To Eligible Residents
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">New York To Send 'Inflation Refund' Checks To Eligible Residents</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-york-to-send-inflation-refund-checks-to-eligible-residents-5858089?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge"><em>Authored by Rachel Acenas via The Epoch Times,</em></a></p>

<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the state’s first-ever “inflation refund,” a one-time payment to eligible residents.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_51.jpg?itok=TXQnygOG" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_51.jpg?itok=TXQnygOG"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="af233046-c1d0-48f4-9c3e-6087e5d059e6" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_51.jpg?itok=TXQnygOG" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Hochul said during a news conference that inflation has driven up costs for New Yorkers, and they should get that money back. The funding, according to the governor, will come from the money the state collected in higher sales taxes because of inflation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“We collected more in sales tax as a result. Unanticipated revenue. I said, this can go into the state coffers, but why not give it to the residents whose pockets it came out of? They paid more than they ever expected. That’s the whole idea behind an inflation refund.”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Collectively, the one-time payment will put $2 billion back in the pockets of over eight million New York taxpayers, Hochul said. The amount of the payment would be based on filing status and income.</p>

<p>Joint tax filers who earn up to $150,000 will receive a $400 check, while those earning between $150,000 and $300,000 will get $300. Single tax filers with incomes up to $75,000 should expect to receive a $200 inflation refund check, and those earning between $75,000 and $150,000 will get a $150 check.</p>

<p>Hochul first proposed her plan of an inflation refund check last December and secured the funding in the fiscal year 2026 state budget agreement. Her initial plan called for higher refunds, specifically $300 for single filers making $150,000 or less, and $500 for joint filers making up to $300,000.</p>

<p>According to data from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/northeast/news-release/consumerpriceindex_newyork.htm">Consumer Price Index</a>, the New York area experienced the highest inflation rate in the country from April 2024 to April 2025, with a rate of 3.9 percent. New York’s rate was much higher than the national average, which was 2.3 percent in April 2025. The New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area experienced a 3.9 percent increase in prices, while core inflation reached 4.3 percent.</p>

<p><strong>In announcing the inflation refund plan, the governor signed a large check while announcing the inflation refund. “We got it done, everybody. We got it done,” she told supporters.</strong></p>

<p>Residents who qualify for the one-time payment don’t need to fill out an application or take any type of action, according to a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/we-got-it-done-governor-hochul-celebrates-huge-budget-win-put-nearly-5000-back-pockets-working">news release</a> by the governor’s office. Rather, the state will automatically send them a check based on their 2023 tax filing. The checks will be mailed over a period of several weeks beginning in the fall of 2025.</p>

<p><strong>As part of the state budget, Hochul is also giving 1.6 million New York families an annual tax credit of up to $1,000 per child under age four and up to $500 per child from four through sixteen, marking the largest expansion of New York’s child tax credit in its history.</strong> The state budget agreement also includes her plan to cut taxes for more than 75 percent of all tax filers in the state.</p>

<p>United Way of New York City President and CEO Grace Bonilla said in a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/we-got-it-done-governor-hochul-celebrates-huge-budget-win-put-nearly-5000-back-pockets-working">statement</a> in response to Hochul’s budget: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“These changes will ease the burden on people who are already facing untenable challenges – forced to choose between feeding their children or paying bills.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to United Way’s 2023 True Cost of Living <a href="https://unitedwaynyc.org/true-cost-of-living/">report</a>,<strong> 50 percent of working-age people in New York City are struggling to make ends meet.</strong></p>

<p>New York’s inflation refund checks are similar to California’s Middle Class Tax Refund program. That one-time payment was issued to eligible recipients between October 2022 and January 2023, to provide relief to residents in the state. California’s refund came in the form of a debit card that required activation.</p>

Title: Water Wars: One-Fifth Of Pakistan's Electricity Comes From Hydro
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Water Wars: One-Fifth Of Pakistan's Electricity Comes From Hydro</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong>India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, a major water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank. </strong>The move came on April 23, within a day of a deadly shooting in Pahalgam, in the Indian-administered part of Kashmir, marking the first time the treaty has been paused since the pact’s inception in 1960. In response, Pakistan stated that an attempt to stop the flow of water would be considered an “act of war”. Tensions mounted between the two <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/8301/the-countries-holding-the-worlds-nuclear-arsenal/">nuclear-armed nations</a> in the following weeks, breaking out into four days of fighting, before quelling again with a ceasefire mediated by the U.S. announced on Saturday, with both nations pulling back from the brink.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27272/water-conflicts/">Water resources</a> are an important part of the equation right now between the two countries. </strong>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1612691/india-and-pakistan-distribution-of-water-according-to-iwt">Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)</a> divides the six main rivers of the Indus basin between the two nations, with the three westerly rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab — supplying Pakistan with water, while the three easterly ones — Ravi, Beas and Sutlej — feed India.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/Water-War-2.3.jpg?itok=OIpylnIP" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Water-War-2.3.jpg?itok=OIpylnIP"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6f459356-1753-4d53-8740-ab2dc77828a0" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Water-War-2.3.jpg?itok=OIpylnIP" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-14/india-suspends-indus-water-treaty-pakistan-tensions-water-war/105286366">reporting</a> by ABC,<strong> in addition to the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, India has also fast-tracked the construction of four new hydropower projects on rivers flowing into Pakistan and refused to share data on river flows with Islamabad.</strong> David Michel, Senior Fellow for the Global Food and Water Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explains in an <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-india-cut-pakistans-indus-river-lifeline">analysis</a> that while India cannot completely stop the water flow to Pakistan in the near term due to its current infrastructure, it can stop the flow of information to its neighbor. He explains: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The IWT requires the parties to share a good deal of data on project development, river flows, and hydrological conditions. By suspending the treaty, India can also cease data sharing, depriving Pakistan of flood warnings, for example, prospectively hampering the nation’s water management and potentially imperiling Pakistani lives and livelihoods.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Observers cite concerns over India’s building of dams, including four which are on one of the westerly rivers intended to supply Pakistan, and flag the issue of what would happen to the flow of water to Pakistan if such infrastructure is expanded to enable more storage.</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan is dependent on the rivers of the Indus basin not only for some of its population’s drinking water, but also for agriculture, which accounts for almost a quarter of the country’s GDP, as well as for power.</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/34459/pakistans-sources-of-electricity-generation/">As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the chart below,</a> using <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/pakistan/electricity">data</a> from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows, 34.6 TWh of electricity in Pakistan was sourced from hydropower in 2022 (latest available data), all of which comes from the Indus basin. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/34459/pakistans-sources-of-electricity-generation/" title="Infographic: One-Fifth of Pakistan's Electricity Comes From Hydro | Statista"><img alt="Infographic: One-Fifth of Pakistan's Electricity Comes From Hydro | Statista" height="501" src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/34459.jpeg" style="max-width: 960px;" width="501" /></a> </p>

<p><strong>This makes it the second most important energy source for electricity in the country</strong>, following only after natural gas (47 TWh or around 27 percent). </p>

<p>The next biggest energy sources are oil (16.6 percent), coal (15.9 percent and nuclear (15.6 percent).</p>

Title: "I Can't Understand My Professor"
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">"I Can't Understand My Professor"</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>By Rob Jenkins of <a href="https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2025/05/01/i-cant-understand-my-professor/">Minding the Campus</a></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My colleague at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minding the Campus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jared Gould, has </span><a href="https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2025/03/27/foreign-students-price-americans-out-of-their-own-workforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written persuasively</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the problem of colleges and universities over-admitting foreign students, who can fill seats that should have gone to American students, drive up costs for everyone, and ultimately take jobs from American workers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, however, a more pressing issue—<strong>although one that is rarely broached, lest the complainant be labeled “xenophobic”</strong>—is that of foreign-born professors, especially those whose command of spoken English is, shall we say, less than optimal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, institutions have come to rely more and more on non-native Ph.D.s. Just scan through the faculty roster at any American university and see how many names you can pronounce. This is a problem for some of the same reasons Jared mentions: Not only did many of these professors take grad-school seats from American students, they eventually took jobs that might have gone to American candidates.</span></p>

<p><em><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/cant%20undertstand%20prof.jpg?itok=9F2Sulib" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/cant%20undertstand%20prof.jpg?itok=9F2Sulib"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ddada6e3-925f-446a-a64b-f0dbb2f1c053" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="374" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/cant%20undertstand%20prof.jpg?itok=9F2Sulib" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s another problem with foreign-born professors, though, on an even more basic level: Students often struggle to understand them in class. </strong>If students literally can’t grasp what the professor is saying, due to a language barrier, how can they learn the material? Often, they resort to essentially teaching themselves, using textbooks, study groups, and online aids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daughter of a good friend is currently in medical school at a large, highly respected Southeastern university. I had a chance to chat with her over the holidays and asked her how it was going. What she said frankly shocked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>According to her, not a single one of her medical school professors, so far, has been American-born. </strong>All speak with thick accents, although some are clearer than others. Asking questions in class doesn’t help much, because she often can’t understand the answers. And she isn’t alone. Her classmates all have the same problem.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how are they supposed to learn this information that is presumably so important for doctors to know—information they will be tested over, repeatedly, throughout their years in medical school, culminating in board examinations?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bright young woman, along with her classmates and many other medical students all over the country, has simply taken matters into her own hands, purchasing expensive software that covers the same material. She attends class religiously each day, then goes home and spends eight or ten more hours watching videos. Despite shelling out tens of thousands of dollars on an “elite” medical school education, she is essentially having to teach herself—all because her professors don’t speak clear English.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just one example of what seems to be a widespread problem. In my 40 years of college teaching and advising, I’ve had dozens of students complain to me that they have one or more professors they can’t understand, particularly in mathematics, engineering, and the hard sciences.</span></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="https://store.zerohedge.com/rancher-direct-clean-food/" data-image-href="https://store.zerohedge.com/rancher-direct-clean-food/" data-link-option="2" href="https://store.zerohedge.com/rancher-direct-clean-food/"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1d7c3fc7-867d-4ae7-baa0-cd61d4246985" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="134" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/TBI_Ad_1500x400px_MemorialDay_1%281%29.jpg?itok=1P4CS8m5" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did we get ourselves into this situation, and how can we get out of it?</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to the first question, which also suggests an answer to the second, is that we got here mainly by prioritizing research over teaching—in some cases, by a wide margin. Indeed, some of our most prestigious institutions seem to value research almost exclusively and teaching hardly at all. Almost any tenure-track professor at a Research 1 university will tell you that their annual evaluations and tenure bids are highly focused on research, publishing, and grant procurement, with teaching coming in a distant second, if that. In other words, if a candidate is an accomplished researcher or has the potential to be, schools don’t really care if students can understand them or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple solution is for institutions to prioritize teaching, or at least make it equal to research. Honestly, most of what passes for “research” these days is either </span><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/diminishing-returns-in-humanities-research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">derivative naval-gazing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.campusreform.org/article/prof-jenkins-plagiarism-just-tip-iceberg/24832"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreproducible nonsense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; only a relative handful of professors are doing truly groundbreaking work in any field. The rest should be expected to teach more and publish less, and be evaluated accordingly. Departments, too, should be judged primarily on how well students learn in their classes, not on how many journal articles they produce or how much grant money they generate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a renewed emphasis on teaching, departments might start to care a little more about whether students can actually understand their professors and make that an integral part of the screening process for new faculty. Some institutions already do this, but every candidate for a faculty position should have to give a public presentation that students are encouraged to attend—bribed with food, if necessary—and their opinions solicited.</span></p>

<p>The quantitative factors used in the GFCI model are grouped into five areas of competitiveness:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Business environment:</strong> Transparency and stability of systems, regulatory complexity</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Human capital: </strong>Access to skill professionals, investment in education</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Quality of physical and digital infrastructure</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Financial sector development: </strong>Accessibility to clients, development of digital solutions</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Reputation:</strong> Trustworthiness of legal and regulatory systems</p>
	</li>
</ul><h2>Regional Insights</h2>

<p>We’ve summarized the main highlights from each GFCI region below.</p>

<h4>North America</h4>

<p>North America has four centers in the top 10: <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/us-cities-by-gdp-map/">New York</a>, San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The most improved within North America are Miami and Vancouver, which both climbed over 10 places in the ranking.</p>

<h4>Western Europe</h4>

<p>London is the region’s dominant center, with seven other cities featuring in the top 20. The average rating across Western Europe increased by 2.14%.</p>

<h4>Asia Pacific</h4>

<p>Asia Pacific has six centers in the top 20, with four belonging to China (Hong Kong SAR, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing). Looking elsewhere, Hangzhou, New Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, and Manila all rose six or more places.</p>

<h4>Middle East & Africa</h4>

<p>The region’s leading centers are Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with Dubai climbing four places to 12th in GFCI 37. Meanwhile, Tel Aviv, Kuwait City, and Johannesburg each fell more than 10 places.</p>

Title: Buffett Liquidated Citigroup, Dumped Financial Stocks As US Entered Trade War : Full 13F Breakdown
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Buffett Liquidated Citigroup, Dumped Financial Stocks As US Entered Trade War : Full 13F Breakdown</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Warren Buffett already stunned the Berkshire faithful with his "shocking" announcement last weekend that the 94 year old billionaire was, <em>gasp, </em>finally retiring as CEO of the $1 trillion+ conglomerate. Luckily, there were no surprises in Buffett's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012325005701/xslForm13F_X02/form13fInfoTable.xml">latest 13F filing </a>published at the close today: while Buffett did not add any new positions in the quarter that preceded Trump’s trade war, he did liquidate two of his previous large holdings, and continued to trim positions in financial stocks while adding to a handful others.</p>

<p>Buffett started off the last year of his tenure as CEO of Berkshire by exiting his once-huge position in Citigroup, while also shrinking his holdings in Capital One Financial and continuing to trim his longtime stake in Bank of America.</p>

<p>While it is still a top 5 position valued at $26.4 billion at the end of Q1, Buffett started selling his BofA stake in July last year, without providing any explanation for the move. He now owns 8.3% of the US lender and is no longer its biggest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Berkshire also fully liquidated its stake in Brazil’s Nubank, which has grown into one of the world’s biggest digital banks since its 2013 founding. Berkshire bought a $500 million stake before the bank went public in 2021. The stock has gained 46% since. </p>

<p>On the plus side, Buffett added to his stake in Constellation Brands, which now totals 6.6%, or $2.2 billion; he opened the new position in the alcohol distributor in the last quarter of 2024. He also bought more Sirius XM Holdings and Occidental Petroleum, where he is by far the largest holder with 27% of the shares outstanding. In addition, the company requested confidentiality treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning Berkshire was allowed to omit one of more holdings in its filing Thursday.</p>

<p>After aggressively selling down his stake in Apple for much of 2023 and 2024, his AAPL shares were untouched in Q1 and still represents the billionaire’s portfolio’s most valuable holding.</p>

<p>Here is a full breakdown of what Berkshire did in Q1. It added to position in:</p>

<ul><li>Occidental Petroleum, +763,017 million shares to 264.9 million shares, or $13.1 billion as of March 31</li>
	<li>Verisign, +18.423 shares to 13.3 million shares or $3.4 billion</li>
	<li>SiriusXM, +2.3 million shares to 119.8 million shares, or $2.7 billion</li>
	<li>Constellation Brands, +6.4 million shares to 12.009 million, or $2.2 billion</li>
	<li>Dominos Pizza, +238,613 shares to 2.6 million shares, or $1.2 billion</li>
	<li>Pool Corp, +865,311 shares to 1.5 million shares, or $466 million</li>
	<li>Heico Corp, +112,401 shares to 1.2 million shares, or $245.2 million</li>
</ul><p>It reduced its positions in:</p>

<ul><li>Bank of America, by 48.7 million shares to 631.6 million shares, or $26.4 billion as of March 31</li>
	<li>Davita, by 953,091 shares to 35.1 million shares, or $5.4 billion</li>
	<li>Liberty Media, by 3.3 million shares to 19.4 million shares or $1.4 billion</li>
	<li>Capital One, by 300K shares to 7.150 million shares, or $1.3 billion</li>
	<li>T-Mobile, by 469K shares to 3.9 million shares, or $1.0 billion</li>
	<li>Charter Communications, by 7500 shares to 1.98 million shares, or $731 million</li>
</ul><p>Buffett largely refrained from making large acquisitions in recent years, instead building a cash pile that reached nearly $350 billion by the end of March. At the conglomerate’s annual meeting this month, the billionaire said the recent market downturn was “really nothing,” pointing to times in Berkshire’s history when his company’s stock lost half of its value in short spans.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/buffett-step-down-berkshire-ceo-year-end-cash-hoard-hits-record-348-billion">reported at the start of May</a>, Buffett will step down as chairman at year-end. He built Berkshire into a business valued at more than $1.1 trillion, with individuals as well as professionals closely watching and sometimes imitating his investment moves.</p>

<p>Shares of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire have gained more than 11% so far this year. The S&P 500 Index has risen less than 1% during the same period.</p>

<p>A full breakdown of Berkshire's holdings is below.</p>

Title: Colorado Could Be The Parental Rights Canary In The Coal Mine
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Colorado Could Be The Parental Rights Canary In The Coal Mine</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://realclearwire.com/articles/2025/05/12/colorado_could_be_the_parental_rights_canary_in_the_coal_mine_1109615.html">Authored by J.P. De Gance via RealClearReligion</a>,</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some may look at the pending Colorado legislation destroying parental rights and wrongly see the last gasps of a dying woke regime.   </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/686651_jpg_92.jpg?itok=dhQfbwNI" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/686651_jpg_92.jpg?itok=dhQfbwNI"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="359eb5b6-d1f0-4cb6-839a-30b1f3812d43" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="375" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/686651_jpg_92.jpg?itok=dhQfbwNI" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The dystopian state house bill, HB 25-1312 or better known as the “Kelly Loving Act,” <strong>allows the Colorado government to remove a child from her parents if parents refuse to go along with her gender dysphoria and self-styled new identity</strong>. It represents the most totalitarian legal destruction of parental rights in American history. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The bill passed the Colorado House and Senate. To understand why this destructive legislation might become Colorado law, we need to look closer at the cultural understructure. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The most politically powerful defenders of children are married, biological parents. </strong>In 1970, married households with kids under age 18 made up 40 percent of all American households. Today, that number stands at just 17.8 percent of all households. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Colorado sits on the front edge of the demographic cliff with <a href="https://denverite.com/2024/11/07/denver-school-closures-dps-consolidation-proposal-2024/">K-12 schools already starting to shutter</a>. According to the US Census, married households with kids in the state are just 81 percent of the national average at 14.4 percent of all households.   </p>

<p dir="ltr">So, this evil legislation makes some political sense. The less married parents with kids in any electorate district, the more vulnerable parents and kids are to the onslaught of state power. </p>

<p dir="ltr">And given current trends in marriage and fertility rates – our future politics may look a lot more like Colorado’s politics than anyone realizes. This legal threat to parental rights will spread. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Here’s what we know both from the data and common sense.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>A man not married to the mother of his child is less present in the day-to-day life of his child. </strong>Nearly all unmarried dads are nonresident dads who see their child less than once a week within two years of becoming a nonresident dad. A large portion of these men see their child only monthly or even less. <strong>These children don’t just lack the vital day-to-day influence that only a loving, present father can provide, they lose a powerful advocate and protector – particularly in politics.   </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Assuming she hasn’t been captured by gender ideology herself, the financially struggling single mom often becomes a patronage client of the same legislator who is now taking away her parental rights. </p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s a textbook example of divide and conquer.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Here’s the reality.<strong> Marriage and fertility – either in its vibrance or absence – is a powerful political force in our nation’s politics. It often goes unnoticed by the politically conscious.  </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Seeing fertility collapse in Roman antiquity, Octavian focused part of his rule on policy to boost fertility. He failed and Rome struggled to form native-born armies eventually falling to the Barbarians.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">The strength of early Rome’s family and fertility only rebounded through the evangelism of Christian missionaries and the revolutionary power of the Gospel’s teaching on marriage, which produced the greatness of the West. Reproducing such a revival is vital. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Today, many parents and most church leaders are unaware of the hellscape and nihilism facing young people in sex and relationships.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>A recent study by Date Psychology found that nearly half of young men have never asked a woman out.   </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/what-happens-when-children-are-exposed-to-pornography">The average age of first porn use in the United States is now 12</a>. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2021.1985025?casa_token=pcnT3z3Ifc4AAAAA%3AbELDPJ4ZABh7lVa87gP0x9cfIQk6Fo3rtgxR4DMjIaVItD3FcRXmDS7Hp1UAdtCRGZ_AH2WzSpG1">Choking in consensual sex has become terrifyingly common</a> as porn becomes ubiquitous. The average age of first marriage for women is now far past peek fertility and moves ever closer to the age of the geriatric pregnancy. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Many who lament the current state of play choose to focus all the attention on bashing men – as if society got here merely because of one sex. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Our economy devasted the jobs where men inherently thrived. K-12 pedagogy became hyper feminized causing boys to conclude school was for girls resulting in women now outnumbering men in college admissions by a 50 percent margin.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Popular media portrays women heroes as unconquerable while fathers are often portrayed as doofuses. Family law continues to skew against husbands.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>This is all to say there are plenty of contributing factors to our situation. But, what’s the solution?  </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Unless one embraces a life of Pauline celibacy, we ought to first recognize the obvious: men and women need one another. We were made for each other, and this reality is designed into our very bodies.   </p>

<p dir="ltr">Adversarial approaches are unhelpful.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Equal in dignity, men and women both deserve to be treated as an end in and of themselves and not treated as a means.   </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">We each must learn to live the radical biblical call of “being subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.” The paradox of Christian marriage is that a life of sacrificial love lived for the other is where health and happiness most reliably flow. </p>

<p dir="ltr">So, an effective, long-term response to legislation like what is making its way into Colorado law, requires us to defend children by getting practical and tactical about renewing healthy marriage at the retail level. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>For churches, this means altering their ministry to proclaim the timeless truths of the Gospel into this moment.  </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In all, 85 percent of American churches invest nothing, zero budget dollars, on marriage and relationship ministry. Instead, the local church should be a life-giving oasis providing the civilizational cure.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Young people need to find within the church an “in real life” community where they can meet a partner outside of either the consumerism of dating apps or the didactics of a Bible study.  While living in a community of believers, they ought to also learn how to prioritize, date and discern a marriageable partner. They ought to hear about why the erectile dysfunction ads constantly run during live sports and be challenged to avoid the poison of pornography.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">The social science supporting marriage is overwhelmingly positive. Married people with children who attend church are among the happiest and healthiest in America. Contrary to popular media accounts, married church goers even report having sex more frequently than their secular peers.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The church must embrace becoming the counterculture in a deeply practical way.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Effective political activism is vital to confront immediate threats.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But, increasing healthy marriages in the culture is necessary. It is the only path to defeating the radicals’ assault on children and parental rights. Otherwise, Colorado’s legislation will one day become national legislation. </p>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong>India and Pakistan, currently experiencing a ceasefire </strong>after clashes along their disputed border, have caught global attention as the two neighbors are both armed with nuclear weapons. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2024/role-nuclear-weapons-grows-geopolitical-relations-deteriorate-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now">data</a> from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), <strong>each nation owns around 170 nuclear warheads.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/8301/the-countries-holding-the-worlds-nuclear-arsenal/">As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the following chart,</a> India has added 8 nuclear warheads to its arsenal since January 2023, increasing from 164 warheads to 172. North Korea and China also expanded their arsenals in this time period, bringing their total figures to an estimated 50 warheads and 500 warheads, respectively.</p>

<p><em>You will find more infographics at <a href="https://www.statista.com/chartoftheday/">Statista</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Currently, there are estimated to be 9,585 <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4269/nuclear-weapons/">nuclear warheads</a> in military stockpiles for potential use across nine countries, with Russia and the U.S. accounting for 8,088 of these. </strong></p>

<p>There are also an estimated 2,536 retired warheads that are yet to be dismantled.</p>

<p>The<strong> two European nuclear powers, France and the UK, together have 515 operational nuclear warheads</strong>. </p>

<p>With the exception of North Korea, <a href="https://de.statista.com/infografik/32030/anzahl-der-weltweit-durchgefuehrten-atomwaffentests/">none of the nations in possession of nuclear warheads have tested them since the 1990s</a>.</p>

<h2>Runs in the family...</h2>

<p>As covered previously in a ZeroHedge <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/epstein-diddy-spotlight-shines-james-comeys-prosecutor-daughter">piece</a> titled "From Epstein To Diddy: Spotlight Shines On James Comey's Prosecutor Daughter", Comey's offspring smell a little swampy as well. From the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a thinly covered news story from <a href="https://www.billboard.com/business/legal/maurene-ryan-comey-ghislaine-maxwell-lead-prosecutor-joins-diddy-trial-1235843958/">December</a> that's suddenly relevant again (read on), New York Prosecutor <strong>Maurene Comey </strong>-<strong> </strong>whose father <strong>James Comey</strong> famously refused to prosecute Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information & then participated in the Russia collusion hoax - joined the prosecution against Combs. The younger Comey has previously worked as lead prosecutor on both the <strong>Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases</strong>, <strong>as well as that of former Epstein cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Maurene Comey becamse a US attorney in the Southern District of New York in 2015.</p>

<p>In 2019, when she was just 30-years-old, <strong>Comey became one of the lead prosecutors in the Jeffrey Epstein case</strong> before he was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Two years later, she became one of three <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/maurene-comey-james-comey-daughter-leading-jeffrey-epstein-case-2019-7">lead prosecutors</a> in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell</strong>, Epstein's partner in crime and daughter of suspected Mossad operative <a href="https://x.com/basedspinach/status/1895205597718683709">Robert Maxwell</a>. </p>

<p>Before becoming a US attorney, Comey clerked for US District Court chief judge Loretta Preska of the SDNY - who notably oversaw a long-running <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/virginia-giuffre-lawsuit-led-to-criminal-case-ghislaine-maxwell-epstein-2021-11">defamation case</a> filed by<strong> Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Comey was also involved in the case of</strong> <strong>Nicholas Tartaglione,</strong> a former NYPD officer who was convicted of killing four men in 2016, and who was briefly <strong>Epstein's cellmate</strong> in the Manhattan Metro Correctional Center. Tartaglione claims to have <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2019/07/26/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-cop-cellmate-says-he-saved-multimillionaire-sex-offender-from-hanging-source/">helped Epstein</a> after 'finding him unconscious' (and totally not trying to kill him) prior to Epstein's actual death.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/230407131213-nicholas-tartaglione.jpg?itok=2iudzxPs" data-link-option="0" href="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/230407131213-nicholas-tartaglione.jpg?itok=2iudzxPs"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="833a1ef4-aa89-4fa7-9507-10e94404fc12" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/230407131213-nicholas-tartaglione.jpg?itok=2iudzxPs" alt="" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In 2016, Tartaglione suspected a man named Martin Luna had stolen money from him - for which "Tartaglione tortured Martin and then forced one of Martin’s nephews to watch as he strangled him to death with a zip-tie," according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-us-attorney-damian-williams-conviction-nicholas-tartaglione">statement</a> by the US Attorney's Office.</p>

<p>Two days after Epstein's death, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html#"><em>NY Times</em></a> reporter James B Stewart, who had spent 90 minutes with Epstein a year prior, wrote "The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that <strong>Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it.</strong> He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, <strong>some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing,</strong> including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.</p>

<p>And so, whether this is just a case of 'it's a small world' or something a little (or a lot) less innocent, <strong>James Comey's daughter is now involved in a second case where high-profile celebrities and politicians may have been secretly filmed engaging in sexual activity with minors.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comey's deep state tentacles make the cryptic Instragram post that much more unsettling. Might there be some hints in Comey's shitty novel? Donald Barr's <em>Space Relations </em>anyone?</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton can’t help herself when it comes to President Trump, posting on X Wednesday “No one gives someone a $400 million jet for free without expecting anything in return. Be serious,” in reference to Trump’s acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747 from Qatar’s royal family.</p>

<p>Everyone quickly pointed out the hypocrisy, given the Clinton Foundation’s history of accepting substantial donations from Arab states, including Qatar, during her tenure as Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation has received over $40 million from Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and even accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar in 2011 without informing the State Department, despite Clinton’s agreement to disclose such contributions for review.</p>

Title: Lethal Lidar: Volvo SUV's Infrared Beam Fries Smartphone Camera
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Lethal Lidar: Volvo SUV's Infrared Beam Fries Smartphone Camera</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>High-powered lidar systems—commonly used in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles—emit infrared laser beams to map their environments. While invisible to the human eye, these beams can damage smartphone camera sensors, as one Reddit user recently discovered the hard way. </p>

<p>Reddit user <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1ke98nv/never_film_the_new_ex90_because_you_will_break/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://www.thedrive.com/news/volvo-ex90s-lidar-sensor-will-fry-your-phones-camera">Jeguetelli</a></em> recently shared a video on the <em>r/Volvo</em> subreddit showing a smartphone camera's image sensor being fried after filming the front-mounted lidar sensor on the Volvo EX90—a fully electric, seven-seat luxury SUV that serves as Volvo's flagship entry into the electric vehicle market.</p>

<p>"<strong>Never film the new Ex90 because you will break your cell camera.Lidar lasers burn your camera</strong>," Jeguetelli wrote. </p>

<p>Auto blog <em><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/volvo-ex90s-lidar-sensor-will-fry-your-phones-camera">The Drive</a> </em>pointed out, "It should be said that the risk here is inherent to lidar technology, and has nothing to do with Volvo's specific implementation on the EX90. In fact, earlier this year, the automaker even issued a warning against directing external cameras at the vehicle's lidar pod for the very reasons discussed."</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Volvo's website states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Lidar light waves can damage external cameras</em></strong><em>: Do not point a camera directly at the lidar. The lidar, being a laser based system, uses infrared light waves that may cause damage to certain camera devices. This can include smartphones or phones equipped with a camera.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"<strong>Would this damage your car's backup camera, if a LIDAR equipped car tailgates you?</strong>" one Redditor asked. </p>

<p>Another person said, "<strong>Thank god for Apple Care." </strong></p>

<p>The ongoing debate in the tech world centers on LiDAR vs. cameras—a big divide in the race toward fully autonomous vehicles, especially when comparing Tesla's camera-only approach to rivals embracing LiDAR.</p>

<p><strong>Elon Musk famously called LiDAR a "crutch,"</strong> arguing that camera vision powered by advanced AI is sufficient for FSD.</p>

<p>"In my view, it's a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum that they will find very hard to get out of." Musk said several years ago, adding, "Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not."</p>

<p>The Counterargument: Tesla's competitors argue that LiDAR provides critical redundancy and reliability, especially for safety-critical applications like robotaxis.</p>

<p>The proliferation of LiDAR sensors on vehicles should come with a public service warning: avoid pointing smartphone cameras at these devices emitting infrared laser beams—they can permanently damage image sensors.</p>

<p>Also, will LiDAR risk burning camera sensors on Tesla vehicles? </p>

Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Dem Lawmaker Facing Calls For Expulsion And Arrest After Allegedly Assaulting ICE Agents Outside Detention Center In NJ</span>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said the<strong> three Democrat lawmakers who scuffled with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in New Jersey last Friday committed felonies.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/demrep.JPG?itok=2n-qR7Vh" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/demrep.JPG?itok=2n-qR7Vh"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3287d87d-caeb-4fd8-a667-e3c60f8e61a0" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="288" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/demrep.JPG?itok=2n-qR7Vh" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>New Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Robert Menendez and LaMonica McIver were part of a mob that protested at the Delaney Hall detention center, a privately run facility under contract with ICE that houses non-citizens awaiting immigration proceedings or deportation.</p>

<p><strong>The lefty protesters were demanding that the center be shut down, <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/12/us-news/feds-weigh-assault-charges-for-pols-who-protested-nj-ice-center/">the New York Post</a> reported.</strong></p>

<p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with trespassing after entering the facility and refusing to leave.</p>

<p>An ugly scuffle ensued as the lawmakers surrounded Baraka in an apparent attempt to shield the mayor from the ICE agents making the arrest.</p>

<p>“<strong>Don’t touch us!</strong>” McIver (in red) screamed over and over as officers tried to break through their blockade.</p>

<p>An online video shows the hefty McIver (in red), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, throwing punches and shoving law enforcement officers as they tried to regain control.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYF0wTbG9Ug?si=kSSmOEi1vbIoiYa0" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Watson Coleman said the group of lawmakers had already visited the facility and come out to talk to the mayor when they were the ones allegedly assaulted by ICE agents.</p>

<p>“Since DHS has been lying about this, allow me to correct the record. This scuffle, during which an ICE agent physically shoved me, occurred AFTER we had entered the Delaney Hall premises,” she <a href="https://x.com/RepBonnie/status/1920989902520340582">posted on  X,</a> Friday.</p>

<p>“<strong>We entered the facility, came BACK OUT to speak to the Mayor, and then ICE agents began shoving us. This is not how we entered the facility. We were escorted in by guards, because we have lawful oversight authority to be there</strong>,” she said.</p>

<p>”Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said on CNN Friday that DHS has damning body-cam video of the scuffle that has not yet been released to the public.</p>

<p>“We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer,” McLaughlin said.</p>

<p>“<strong>These members of Congress, this mayor and these protesters are not above the law</strong>,” McLaughlin noted on “Fox & Friends,” Monday.</p>

<p>Noem hinted that more arrests are being considered during an appearance on Fox News, Tuesday night.</p>

<p>“This wasn’t oversight, this was committing felonies. This was going out and attacking people who stand up for the rule of law. And it was absolutely horrible,” Noem told the host Jesse Waters, noting that the acts of violence were committed in defense of violent criminals— rapists, murderers, and members of foreign terrorist organizations victimizing American communities.</p>

<p>“<strong>What are they trying to do? Get these people released back into the country so there can be more Laken Rileys?</strong>” she asked. “I just don’t understand what their point is. They’ve completely lost their minds.”</p>

<p>Noem said it was up to the Department of Justice to decide whether to press charges against the Democrat lawmakers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzGH__XPBM8?si=pFm-7phviNCGKPFb" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) introduced a resolution Tuesday to strip the House members of all their committee assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Rep. Marjory Taylor Greene went further Wednesday, saying McIver needs to be expelled.</strong></p>

<p>Greene <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1922661736718491821">posted a photo on X</a> showing McIver “couldn’t even look up as video played of her assaulting ICE officers” during a Homeland Security hearing Wednesday.</p>

<p>“She has zero respect for law enforcement or the rule of law, which is especially disgraceful as we honor law enforcement during Police Week,” the congresswoman added. “This isn’t just grounds for censure or removal from committees. LaMonica McIver should be EXPELLED from Congress.”</p>

<p>During the hearing Wednesday, <strong>Noem again argued that the Democrat lawmakers were not conducting oversight when they fought with ICE agents.</strong></p>

<p>“What happened on May 9 at Delaney Hall was not oversight. It was a political stunt that put the safety of our law enforcement agents, our staff, and our detainees at risk,” she testified.  “This behavior was lawless, and it was beneath this body. Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities.”</p>

<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), meanwhile,  criticized the Trump administration over their handling of the incident, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5299452-homeland-security-secretary-accuses-democrats-felony/">the Hill</a> reported.</p>

<p>“If anyone’s breaking the law in this situation, it’s not members of Congress, it’s the Department of Homeland Security,” she said in an Instagram video posted Sunday.</p>

<p>“<strong>It’s people like Tom Homan and Secretary Kristi Noem</strong>,” she added.</p>

<p>“You lay a finger on someone, on Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman … or any of the representatives that were there, you lay a finger on them, we are going to have a problem,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “Because the people who are breaking the law are the people not abiding by it.”</p>

<p>Via Getty, the peaceful January 6 protester known as “the Lectern Guy,” shared his own thoughts on the fracas over the weekend.</p>

<p>“<strong>United States Representative LaMonica McIver has still not been arrested after assaulting multiple federal officers on video</strong>,” Getty<a href="https://x.com/lecternleader/status/1921552087202017300"> posted on X</a> Sunday. “Within 48 hours of smiling and waving in the Capitol on J6, I was in county jail isolation under 24-hour supervision, charged with 3 crimes, 2 were lies, the other debatable,” he continued.</p>

<p>“They put me in an ankle monitor and told me I was I was a danger to my community. Meanwhile, this animal is still collecting a paycheck from our tax dollars,” Getty added bitterly.</p>

<p><a href="https://wfin.com/fox-political-news/scoop-gop-plans-investigation-into-ice-threats-after-dems-storming-of-facility/">Fox News reported</a> Wednesday that House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is opening an investigation into threats facing ICE facilities in the wake of the attack on Delaney Hall Detention Center.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News Digital was told that Jordan is expected to schedule a hearing for next Tuesday, with former ICE and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials expected among the witness panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Republicans leaders, according to Fox, are still discussing what, if any, consequences could be in store for Reps. Watson Coleman, Menendez and  McIver.</p>

Title: Putin Removes Commander Of Russia's Ground Forces In Another Defense Shake-Up
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Putin Removes Commander Of Russia's Ground Forces In Another Defense Shake-Up</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>The longtime commander of Russia's ground forces, Army General Oleg Salyukov, has been relieved of his command by order of President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. </p>

<p>Salyukov has led the Ground Forces as 'commander-in-chief' <strong>since 2014</strong>, making his removal a major decision amid what appears an ongoing shake-up of military leadership.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/landforces.jpg?itok=fFfTmzsJ" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/landforces.jpg?itok=fFfTmzsJ"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c6fe3e37-b35d-434a-93ac-ce9643b62cc1" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="358" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/landforces.jpg?itok=fFfTmzsJ" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Chief of the Russian Land Forces Oleg Salyukov (far left) attends prior year's Victory Day, in Moscow, on May 9, 2024. Reuters</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>He just literally oversaw Moscow's Victory Day parade on May 9, and so his removal was likely a highly unexpected development.</p>

<p>As of yet, the Kremlin has offered no specific reason for the top commander's removal. Russia has continued making gains on the battlefield, particularly near Pokrovsk. But the advance has become <strong>a very slow grind</strong>.</p>

<p>Some the latest gains this week in Donetsk are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/russia-grabs-a-bit-more-of-ukraine-as-it-heads-into-peace">as follows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Russian forces captured the settlement of Kotlyarivka, southwest of the embattled area of Pokrovsk, on Monday</strong>, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said.</em></p>

<p><em>The seizure brought Russian forces to within 3.7km (2.3 miles) of the regional border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine. Russian forces also forced their way into the village of Myrolyubivka, east of Pokrovsk, and claimed to have taken the entire settlement.</em></p>

<p><em>On Wednesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed its forces took the community of Mykhailovka, also in Donetsk.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it could be that Putin is growing impatient, and wants even greater breakthroughs at a moment peace negotiations mediated by the US are gaining steam. This huge figure points to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RUSSIA DEPLOYS 640,000 TROOPS IN WAR AGAINST UKRAINE: MILITARY</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Salyukov's removal comes after a series of major defense ministry shake-ups which stretch well into 2023, which had also seen Sergei Shoigu removal as Defense Minister (and 'promoted' into a top security council role).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en" xml:lang="en">The commander of Russia's Ground Forces Army General Oleg Salyukov has left his post and has been appointed deputy secretary of the security council under former defense ministry Sergei Shoigu.

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>According to prior <a href="https://www.ifri.org/en/papers/commanders-putins-long-war-purged-reshuffled-and-disgruntled">analysis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Putin typically prioritizes loyalty over competence, which makes the command structure incapable of addressing sudden shifts in the combat environment</strong>. The recent profound shake-up of and purges in the Defense Ministry have resulted in a serious bureaucratic disorganization of this structure that is crucial for sustaining the war effort. </em></p>

<p><em>The lack of any changes in the General Staff <strong>weakens the ability to learn from experience and compromises the authority of the high command</strong>. Angst and anger among the fighting generals caused by the ineptness of the high command is a major source of political risk, which Putin can neither ignore nor properly address.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed this analysis remains true, and it's hard to imagine someone with more experience than Salyukov - given that he has commanded the country's ground forces for a decade, including through well over three years of a complex Ukraine battlefield.</p>

Title: VDH: The Real First 100 Days
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">VDH: The Real First 100 Days</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://amgreatness.com/2025/05/15/the-real-first-100-days/"><em>Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Pundits are confused about what to make of the first 100 days of the second Trump administration.</strong></p>

<p>Supporters talk of <strong>“flooding the zone,” </strong>believing Trump is making so many changes so quickly that his opposition is reduced to deer-in-the-headlights infancy.</p>

<p>They must be right when the nation suffers daily Democratic pottymouth videos, vandalism of Teslas, infantile meltdowns at congressional witnesses, rioting against federal agents to protect illegal alien felons, protesting on behalf of women beaters, M-13 gangbangers, human traffickers, and assaulters, and visa-holding violent students praising Hamas terrorists.</p>

<p>In contrast, opponents either claim that Trump’s first three months are either directionless chaos or a Hitlerian nightmare or both.</p>

<p><strong>But what is really happening?</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-15_11-02-36.jpg?itok=Z8_DB-XT" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-15_11-02-36.jpg?itok=Z8_DB-XT"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7dcd9197-d30c-4f6a-9094-6cf377e59743" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="276" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-15_11-02-36.jpg?itok=Z8_DB-XT" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong><u>One</u>, Trump is finally addressing the problems that proverbially “cannot go on forever, and so they won’t go on.”</strong></p>

<p><em>When, if ever, would the left have closed the southern border? After 10, 30, 50 million illegal aliens?</em></p>

<p><em>How many more criminal illegal entrants was the Biden administration willing to allow into American neighborhoods—500,000? 1 million? 3 million?</em></p>

<p><em>How long was the world simply going to ignore the human destruction on the doorstep of Europe?</em></p>

<p><em>Would Biden or Harris have sought a ceasefire? Or would it have taken another 1.5, 3, or even 5 million more dead, wounded, and missing Ukrainians and Russians?</em></p>

<p>Nor did past administrations ever seek a solution to the massive national debt, much less the uncontrollable budget and trade deficits.</p>

<p><strong>All prior presidents passed the day of judgment on to some vague future presidency, assured that their money printing would at least not blow up on their watch.</strong></p>

<p>All moaned that China was piling up huge trade surpluses while denying its own population the usual modern safety net. They knew Beijing’s aim was to use the trillions of dollars in trade surpluses to build a new massive military, a greater arsenal of nuclear bombs, and a new imperial Belt and Road overseas empire.</p>

<p>Yet no administration did anything but greenlight American outsourcing and offshoring while ignoring Chinese trade cheating and technology theft.</p>

<p>Indeed, prior presidencies appeased and enriched China on the foolish belief that such indulgence would lead to Chinese prosperity, and with such Western-style affluence, soon a globalized, democratic, and supposedly friendly China.</p>

<p>In sum, we just witnessed all at once a 100-day, 360-degree effort to address all the existential challenges that we knew were unsustainable but were either afraid or incompetent to address.</p>

<p><strong><u>Second</u>, the administration apparently wants to confront the source of these crises and believes it is the progressive project.</strong></p>

<p>The left maintains real political power not by grass-roots popularity, but rather by unelected institutional clout. The party of democracy uses anti-democratic means to achieve its ends of perpetual control.</p>

<p>It wages lawfare through the weaponization of the state, local, and federal courts.</p>

<p>It exercises executive power through cherry-picked federal district and circuit judges and their state and local counterparts.</p>

<p>The permanent bureaucracies and huge federal workforce are mostly left-wing, unionized, and weaponized by a progressive apparat. Their supreme directive is to amalgamate legislative, judicial, and executive power into the hands of the unelected Anthony Faucis, Jim Comeys, and Lois Lerners of the world—and thus to override or ignore both popular plebiscites and the work of the elected Congress.</p>

<p>Over ninety percent of the media—legacy, network, social, and state—are left-wing. Their mission is not objectivity but, admittedly, indoctrination.</p>

<p><strong>Academia is the font of the progressive project. Ninety percent of the professoriate are left-wing and activist—explaining why campuses believe they are above the rules and laws of the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Congress.</strong></p>

<p>Add into the mix the blue-chip Accela corridor law firms and the globalized corporate and revolving-door political elite.</p>

<p>The net result is clear: almost everything the vast majority of Americans and their elected representatives did not want—far-left higher education, a Pravda media, biological men destroying women’s sports, an open border, 30 million illegal aliens, massive debt, a weaponized legal system, and a politicized Pentagon—became the new culture of America.</p>

<p><strong>So, Trump is not just confronting unaddressed existential crises but also the root causes of why, when, and how they become inevitable and nearly unsolvable.</strong></p>

<p>His answer is a messy, knock-down-drag-out counterrevolution to reboot the country back to the middle where it once was and where the Founders believed it should remain.</p>

<p><strong>His right and left opponents call such pushback chaotic, disruptive, and out of control.</strong></p>

<p>But the counterrevolution appears disorderly and upsetting, mostly to those who originally birthed the chaos; it certainly does not to the majority of Americans who finally wanted an end to the madness.</p>

Title: Meta Stumbles: Delays Release Of Flagship "Behemoth" AI Model Over Performance Concerns
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Meta Stumbles: Delays Release Of Flagship "Behemoth" AI Model Over Performance Concerns</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A new report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-is-delaying-the-rollout-of-its-flagship-ai-model-f4b105f7">The Wall Street Journal</a> hit the wires late Thursday during the U.S. cash session, revealing that Meta is reportedly delaying the release of its flagship AI model, "Behemoth," due to internal concerns over its performance and mounting questions about its multibillion-dollar splurge in AI investments.</p>

<p>Initially slated for an April release around Meta's inaugural AI conference (LlamaCon) for developers, Behemoth has been pushed to late in the second half of this year.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/GrA2C7PXYAAhjQb.jpg?itok=GSdUvDba" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/GrA2C7PXYAAhjQb.jpg?itok=GSdUvDba"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="55ce317e-8c04-435c-a182-f6b328624682" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GrA2C7PXYAAhjQb.jpg?itok=GSdUvDba" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The delays come as Meta has publicly claimed that Behemoth outperforms competitors like OpenAI and Google on certain benchmarks. People familiar with the delays say Behemoth has faced "training challenges." </p>

<p>Since Meta's first Llama model was released in early 2023, 11 of the 14 original researchers from the company's Fundamental AI Research Team have left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Meta disclosed in its latest <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/meta-soars-after-blowing-away-estimates-hikes-capex-forecast">earnings report</a> that it had raised its capital expenditure forecast to between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from a previous range of $60 billion to $65 billion—a significant portion of that increase earmarked for AI infrastructure.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/meta%20capex_0.jpg?itok=JdGTPKez" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/meta%20capex_0.jpg?itok=JdGTPKez"><img alt="" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="292" src="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/meta%20capex_0.jpg?itok=JdGTPKez" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>This development mirrors delays at other major AI labs, including OpenAI and Anthropic, suggesting that progress in large language models has slowed. </p>

<p>"<strong>Right now, the progress is quite small across all the labs, all the models</strong>," Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor and faculty fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science, told WSJ.</p>

<p>In markets, Meta shares are down a little more than 2% - coming into resistance after a multi-week 37% run. </p>

Title: DHS Reportedly Requests 20,000 National Guard Troops For "Interior Immigration Enforcement"
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">DHS Reportedly Requests 20,000 National Guard Troops For "Interior Immigration Enforcement"</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Democrats had no concern for due process when millions of third-world illegal aliens, including violent criminals and terrorists, invaded the U.S. with help from far-left NGOs. But now, as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportations, suddenly, this same army of left-wing lawmakers is screaming "due process" to delay deportations and clog up the courts. Their legal resistance is seen in federal courts, where remnants of the Biden-Harris regime still cling to power through far-left activist judges hell-bent on obstructing the mandate the American people handed Trump: deport criminal illegal aliens.</p>

<p>If approved, this would mark the first time National Guard members have been used for interior migrant enforcement operations in the U.S.</p>

<p>Here's more from the NYT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Lawyers at the Pentagon were reviewing the request with "interior immigration enforcement," according to a Defense Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. It was unclear what role state National Guard members would play and whether they would be involved in rounding up people for deportation, the official said.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The move only suggests that the Trump administration is preparing to ramp up mass deportations and fulfill the mandate the American voter gave him: restore national security through the deportation of criminal illegal aliens. </p>

<p>Last month, on Truth Social, Trump wrote, "I'm doing what I was elected to do, remove criminals from our Country, but the Courts don't seem to want me to do that," adding, "We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years."</p>

Title: Schiff Slams Clueless Fed, Says Powell Is Living In A Kind Of "Baghdad Bob World"
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Schiff Slams Clueless Fed, Says Powell Is Living In A Kind Of "Baghdad Bob World"</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/peter-schiff-the-fed-admits-it-doesnt-know-anything"><em>Via SchiffGold.com,</em></a></p>

<p>In Wednesday’s episode of The Peter Schiff Show, Peter unpacks <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/fed-holds-rates-acknowledges-economic-uncertainty">the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to hold rates steady</a>, dissecting Jerome Powell’s latest press conference for its contradictions and disconnect from the economic realities faced by Americans. He also critiques ongoing trade policy blunders and warns that political posturing could lead the U.S. into a major economic downturn.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="432" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ZdVq2wG0Wg" title="🔴 Trump's Tariffs Will Make China Great Again - Ep 1025" width="768"></iframe></p>

<p>Peter opens by reflecting on the Fed’s latest move and the market’s reaction, pointing out the <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/peter-schiff-dont-trust-the-rebound-yet">gap between Powell’s rhetoric and investors’ response:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Well as expected [last week], the federal reserve left interest rates unchanged. The fed funds target remains between 4.25 and 4.5%. You know, <strong>I think this was one of the most hawkish press conferences that I’ve seen Powell participate in. </strong>You wouldn’t really know that by the reaction in the stock market. Stock market kind of, you know, just ignored what Powell said. The bond market did get a boost as you would expect.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Noting the mismatch between <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/guest-commentaries/cracked-shells-how-supply-shocks-not-monopoly-drive-egg-prices">the Federal Reserve’s statements and actual inflation data,</a> Peter takes issue with Powell’s assertion that inflation expectations remain grounded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>First of all, in the prepared remarks, one of the interesting comments– or more lie than comment– is that Powell said that inflation expectations remain well anchored and the Fed’s job is to make sure they stay that way. <strong>Now, I don’t know what world Powell is living in, you know, kind of like the Baghdad Bob world from the Gulf War because inflation expectations left the 2% anchor a long time ago. </strong>I mean, hasn’t Powell been paying attention to any of the Michigan numbers that have been coming out on inflation expectations that show, I think, one year expectations with a six handle and five year expectations have got at least a four handle? So we’re nowhere near 2%. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter is quick to highlight how the Fed’s optimistic portrayal of the economy doesn’t match the underlying risks. He questions how Powell can call the current situation “a great place” <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/jobs-last-three-months-saw-downward-revisions-of-57k-on-average">when real economic indicators tell a different story:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>How is Powell describing the economy as being in a great place? How is he saying that inflation is in a great place? How was he saying that the labor market is in a great place?</strong> It doesn’t sound like a great place to me. I mean, a great place would be that the odds of higher inflation are going down, right, not where the odds are going up… That would be a good place, but when you’re admitting that the odds of higher inflation are going up, that’s pretty far from a great place.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turning from monetary policy to international trade, Peter addresses the <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/heres-why-tariffs-wont-bring-back-manufacturing">persistent uncertainty around trade negotiations with China.</a> He suggests that China would be wise to reduce its reliance on American consumers, who are increasingly unable to afford the goods they import:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>But I don’t have a lot of optimism for these China trade talks. And in fact, what <strong>I think the Chinese may finally be doing is the right thing. They’ve been resisting doing the right thing for a long time because there’s always some short-term pain.</strong> Because the biggest mistake that China made, and I’ve been talking about this for decades now, was hitching its cart to our wagon. They tried to service the US consumer, supply the US consumer with goods, without recognizing that the US consumer was broke and really couldn’t afford to pay for the goods.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter concludes with a critique of protectionist policy, using a recent proposal by Donald Trump as a case study in economic misunderstanding. He points out the <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/the-trump-tariffs-why-free-trade-is-the-only-way-forward">self-defeating nature of a proposed 100% tariff</a> on foreign-made films—a move that threatens an industry where the U.S. actually excels internationally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Probably the most ridiculous thing that the president said this week wasn’t even during that interview. It was on a post on Truth Social out of the blue. Trump posts, ‘I’m going to impose a hundred percent tariff on movies filmed outside the United States.’ A hundred percent tariff, right? First of all, the movie industry, Hollywood motion pictures, that’s one of our industries that we have a trade surplus. <strong>We export a lot more movies than we import. So movies, the motion picture industry, Hollywood entertainment, that is not a problem that Donald Trump needs to fix.</strong></em></p>

<p>This was a masterclass.</p>

<p>A dentist congressman came out swinging on fluoride. By the time Kennedy finished, he realized he picked the wrong fight.</p>

<p>Then, a Democrat tried to accuse Kennedy of politicizing children’s health—but he got emotional, broke through the noise, and completely flipped the script on her.</p>

<p>If you watch one thing today, make it this. Kennedy just took the MAHA agenda to the next level.</p>

<p>Right out of the gate in his first major congressional hearing as HHS Secretary, Kennedy laid out a sweeping plan to reshape HHS from the ground up.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s on deck:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Ending “gain-of-function experiments and research based upon radical gender ideology”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A full-scale crackdown on fentanyl and drug addiction</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$94 billion toward better food, fitness, and childcare</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>FDA action to remove toxic chemicals from the food supply</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Slashing wasteful NIH projects</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Merging mental health and addiction programs for faster, better care</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Giving local leaders more power to fix problems in their own communities</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A major upgrade to Head Start, the early education program for low-income children</p>
	</li>
</ul><p><strong>“We intend to make the Trump HHS not just the most effective, but also the most compassionate in U.S. history,”</strong> Kennedy said.</p>

<p>Kennedy fired back: <strong>“</strong>Allow me to answer that by pointing out the absolute cataclysmic disorganization of this agency. <strong>Under your oversight, for 40 years</strong>, we had nine separate offices of Women’s Health.”</p>

<p>And he didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>DeLauro tried to interrupt—“Okay, let me just. I’m going to—”</p>

<p>Then came the line that hit hard:</p>

<p>“The National Toxicity Program issued a report in August, a meta review of all the science that now exists on fluoride, and <strong>showed a direct inverse correlation between fluoride exposure dose and lower IQ</strong>.”</p>

<p>“Which is an issue that we all have to be concerned with. We want high IQ kids right now,” Kennedy added.</p>

Title: White House Has Presented Iran With Written Nuke Deal Proposal In Huge First
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">White House Has Presented Iran With Written Nuke Deal Proposal In Huge First</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong><u>Update(10:30ET)</u>:</strong> With President Trump and his envoy having arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the last leg of the president's Gulf tour, new details of behind the scenes US-Iran negotiations have come to light on Thursday.</p>

<p>In a huge first, the Trump White House has <strong>sent Iran a written proposal toward forging a new nuclear deal</strong>. White House envoy Steve Witkoff has led several rounds of talks, and Axios has revealed that the communication was issued to Tehran last Sunday.</p>

<p>"Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took the proposal back to Tehran for consultations with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, President Masoud Pezeshkian and other top officials," writes <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/iran-deal-proposal-witkoff-enrichment">Axios</a>.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/irannclr.jpg?itok=1L74-vIx" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/irannclr.jpg?itok=1L74-vIx"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cd649d64-ef1c-4763-9017-858bf93606a7" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/irannclr.jpg?itok=1L74-vIx" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Via Associated Press</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>It was the Iranian side which <strong>initiated the swap of written proposals</strong> first, as the talks which have been on since April went from 'indirect' to more <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/iran-deal-proposal-witkoff-enrichment">'direct'</a>:</p>

<ul><li><em>During the third round of talks in late April, Araghchi gave Witkoff an updated document with Iranian ideas for a nuclear deal. This time, Witkoff took the document.</em></li>
	<li><em>A U.S. team of experts studied it and sent the Iranians a list of questions and requests for clarification. The Iranians replied and added questions of their own, two sources said.</em></li>
	<li><em>Meanwhile, Witkoff and his team prepared a U.S. proposal laying out the Trump administration's parameters for an Iranian civilian nuclear program and requirements for monitoring and verification, the sources said.</em></li>
</ul><p>It appears that thus far both sides have received the other's written proposals positively, and that's what was driving President Trump's "olive branch" comments on Tuesday. He had stressed while speaking in Saudi Arabia that <strong>"this is not an offer that will last forever. The time is right now for them to choose."</strong></p>

<p>President Trump followed up on Thursday by saying from Qatar,  "We're in <strong>very serious negotiations </strong>with Iran for long-term peace," according to AFP.</p>

<p>He said, "We're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this... there (are) two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don't want to do it the second."</p>

<p>Trump's comments followed an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iran-enriched-uranium-nuclear-deal-trump-rcna206833">NBC News</a> interview with Ali Shamkhani, a top political, military and nuclear adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said Tehran is prepared to sign a nuclear deal—provided key conditions are met—in exchange for the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>And the fact that written proposals have already been exchanged is yet further confirmation of this positive trend towards peace. Trump has emphasized that Iran can never have a nuclear bomb, but Tehran itself has long said it's not pursuing a nuke, and that its program is only for peaceful domestic energy purposes.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Brent crude prices fell on Thursday as geopolitical risk premiums eased following President Trump's comments during his Gulf tour, where he signaled that the U.S. is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran. Unlike earlier headlines on AI, defense, and aviation deals with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Trump's comments suggested a potential breakthrough in U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

<p>"We're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace," Trump told reporters in a press pool that AFP News first reported. </p>

<p>Speaking in Doha, Qatar, during his Middle East trip, the president said, "We're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this... there (are) two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don't want to do it the second way."</p>

<p>An Iranian source told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-us-is-getting-very-close-nuclear-deal-with-iran-2025-05-15/">Reuters</a> that negotiations with Trump administration officials still needed to bridge some gaps before a final deal could be reached. </p>

<p>Trump's comments followed an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iran-enriched-uranium-nuclear-deal-trump-rcna206833">NBC News</a> interview with Ali Shamkhani, a top political, military and nuclear adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said Tehran is prepared to sign a nuclear deal—provided key conditions are met—in exchange for the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions. </p>

<p>Trump has offered "an olive branch" to Tehran after a multi-month maximum-pressure campaign, including economic sanctions and deploying long-range stealth bombers to America's "<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/military/stealth-bombers-reportedly-deploying-americas-unsinkable-carrier">unsinkable aircraft carrier</a>" - located in the Indian Ocean - ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>However, last week, ahead of Trump's Gulf tour, we spotted at least one of these <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/stealth-bomber-returns-diego-garcia-us-iran-nuclear-talks-head-fourth-round">stealth bombers returning</a> to the U.S. We suggested this may have been an act of goodwill ahead of talks by the U.S. or possibly just a routine flight.  </p>

<p>On Thursday, Brent crude futures fell 3% to $60 a barrel on expectations that a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal would ease sanctions and increase crude oil on international markets.</p>

<p>"The overnight development of a possible nuclear deal is the sole reason for the morning's weakness. If an agreement is reached, Iran agrees to halt enriching weapon grade uranium and the deal is effectively enforced, which is hard to believe, then the Persian Gulf country's crude oil exports can rise by as much as 1 [million barrels per day]," PVM analyst Tamas Varga told CNBC in an emailed statement. </p>

<p>"It sounds price negative, but its impact will possibly be mitigated by OPEC+ rolling back on its plan to release barrels back to the market faster than originally planned," he added.</p>

<p>Goldman trader Rich Privorotsky commented on the development: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Staying with geopolitics there are some rather positive stories emanating out of Iran. "Iran is ready to sign a nuclear deal with certain conditions with President Donald Trump in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, a top adviser to Iran's supreme leader told NBC News on Wednesday." Unclear if the U.S. will agree to the terms but they seem fairly broad: "He said Iran would commit to never making nuclear weapons, getting rid of its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium which can be weaponized, agree to only enrich uranium to the lower levels needed for civilian use, and allow international inspectors to supervise the process, in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions on Iran." (NBC news) If confirmed I think oil could eventually end up heading back to the recent lows and I would continue to express any cyclical concerns in this space.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's the latest commentary from UBS traders:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Oil Equity Resilience Amid Oil Price Drop Oil prices are down, mainly because of a potential deal with Iran. That could mean up to 500kb/d increased supply coming to market very quickly. Oil equities, however, are already underweight for generalists and specialists have already de-grossed, following the OPEC+ surprises so far this year - hence oil equities are proving to be relatively resilient even though the oil price is down.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Trump secures a nuclear deal with Tehran, it would cap off a week of landmark agreements with Gulf nations—collectively worth trillions—and add to an already bullish news cycle for the president. Also, this would mean continued easing of geopolitical risk premiums in the region, in other words, lower energy prices for Trump to pursue his 'America First' agenda.</p>

Title: Ukraine Will Never Recognize Occupied Territories As Russia, Zelensky Says From Turkey
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Ukraine Will Never Recognize Occupied Territories As Russia, Zelensky Says From Turkey</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><strong><u>Update(1105ET)</u>: "</strong>We don’t yet know the official level of Russians, but from what we see, <strong>it looks phony</strong>," Zelensky told reporters in Ankara. So despite the Ukrainian leader earlier declaring "I am here" upon landing in Turkey, he is not in fact at the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul.</p>

<p>This <em>'I am here' yet not actually 'there'</em> charade generated some contradictory headlines earlier on Thursday. Zelensky <strong>continues his performative gestures aimed at impressing one man: Trump</strong>. He even explained that he is sending Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to head the Ukrainian delegation for the Istanbul meeting, now likely underway, <strong>out of respect for Trump and the peace process he initiated</strong>. </p>

<p>The Kremlin side meanwhile says it's ready to make <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/ukraine-russia-talks-istanbul-turkey-intl">compromises</a>:</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy and close aide, Kirill Dmitriev, has praised US President Donald Trump for putting together Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul, the first such direct dialogue between the warring countries since early 2022.</p>

<p>Trump and his team have <strong>"made the impossible possible" </strong>by bringing Moscow and Kiev to the table. Dmitriev further <a href="https://x.com/kadmitriev/status/1922959414924832829">wrote on X</a> that the Istanbul meeting is happening <strong>"against all odds/fierce resistance"</strong> and that if "not derailed last-minute, this could be a historic step to peace."</p>

<p>Dmitriev also specifically named Vice President J.D. Vance, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio - the latter two who are present in Istanbul - as <strong>major contributors to the mediation effort</strong>. The Kremlin had spent the opening years of the conflict blasting the Biden administration for constantly stoking the war and thwarting dialogue, taking Washington-Moscow relations to new historic lows.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/zelensky-istanbul-responds-insult-putin-sending-junior-officials-peace-talks-i-am-here">noted earlier</a>, Ukraine's President <strong>Zelensky is actually in Turkey</strong>, where he's set to meet with President Erdogan - but separately in the <strong>capital of Ankara</strong>, and has boasted that "I am here" and that Putin is not. Zelensky has even called the Russian delegation, largely composed of junior officials, <strong>"phony"</strong>. </p>

<p>President Trump meanwhile, while attending meetings in Qatar, was asked by a reporter why the American leader is not himself present in Turkey for the talks:</p>

<p><em>"Why would he go if I’m not going?"</em></p>

While European states scratched together <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="4" data-mrf-link="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c89gpg4jpllt" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c89gpg4jpllt" mrfobservableid="3d83b61c-39c3-4844-8e66-7a285da414e5" target="_blank"><u>new economic aid</u></a> to Ukraine in April, this cannot make up for the reduction in US support.</p>

<p>In territorial terms, Russia withdrew from Kyiv as a concession to the first Istanbul talks and lost ground in Kharkiv and in Kherson in late 2022. However, Russia has gone on steadily to gain further territory in the Donbas since the end of 2023. So while both sides have scores on the board, Russia now maintains the military upper hand on the battlefield and that seems unlikely to change. These two factors in particular were behind President Trump’s February assertion that Ukraine has <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="5" data-mrf-link="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-ukraine-leaders-dont-have-any-cards-in-talks-on-russias-invasion" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-ukraine-leaders-dont-have-any-cards-in-talks-on-russias-invasion" mrfobservableid="81ba6eb4-ee73-4ff4-9fbf-477fed315a95" target="_blank"><u>no cards to play</u></a>.</p>

<p data-role="headline"><strong>What has stayed the same?</strong></p>

<p>NATO membership is still off the table</p>

<p>The verified documents shared by the New York Times last June confirmed that Ukraine’s neutrality and non-membership of NATO was the central issue agreed upon in 2022. Ukraine was ready to become a “permanently neutral state” that would never join NATO or allow foreign forces to be based on its soil.</p>

<p>There seems no route for Ukraine to resile from that given its currently weakened negotiating position and President Trump’s stated view that NATO membership for Ukraine is <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="6" data-mrf-link="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-not-practical-ukraine-join-nato-get-back-all-land-2025-02-12/" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-not-practical-ukraine-join-nato-get-back-all-land-2025-02-12/" mrfobservableid="6e933750-a559-4750-b74f-8e5616358413" target="_blank"><u>not practical.</u></a> Although Germany’s new foreign Minister, <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="7" data-mrf-link="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/05/10/7511618/" href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/05/10/7511618/" mrfobservableid="86641df8-c59d-41a8-b440-b27dfa2576f1" target="_blank"><u>Johann Wadephul</u></a> recently repeated the line that Ukraine’s path to NATO is irreversible, most have agreed, privately and publicly, that Ukraine’s path to NATO is a fraught if not impossible one.</p>

<p data-role="headline"><strong>Right now, just having the talks is a huge breakthrough</strong></p>

<p>The Istanbul talks would not be happening had the <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="8" data-mrf-link="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tag/trump-administration/" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tag/trump-administration/" mrfobservableid="255b210e-699d-4692-aff0-b367d225ea00">Trump administration</a> not pushed for it so hard. We don’t need to rehash the “did they or didn’t they” debate around why Ukraine abandoned the Istanbul agreement in April 2022. What is clear, is that Ukraine became entrenched, not only in not negotiating with Russia, but in excluding Russia from all discussions on peace in Ukraine from then onward.</p>

<p>Having agreed in principle for Ukraine to accept neutral status Zelensky was pushing his own <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="9" data-mrf-link="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-zelenskiys-10-point-peace-plan-2022-12-28/" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-zelenskiys-10-point-peace-plan-2022-12-28/" mrfobservableid="52a4e14d-a4ae-4de8-82dd-4425a41568eb" target="_blank"><u>ten point peace plan</u></a>. This included, among other things, Russia withdrawing its troops to the pre-2014 border, i.e. giving up Crimea and the Donbass and creating a Euro-Atlantic Security Architecture, by which he meant Ukraine joining NATO. Peace summits were organized in various countries that explicitly excluded Russia, culminating in the Switzerland event on June 15, 2024.</p>

<p>At this event, President Zelensky was dug in deeper on resisting any engagement with Russia until a full withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, which was a completely unrealistic proposal. “Russia can start negotiations with us even tomorrow without waiting for anything – if they <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="10" data-mrf-link="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/16/summit-demands-ukraines-territorial-integrity-urges-dialogue-to-end-war" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/16/summit-demands-ukraines-territorial-integrity-urges-dialogue-to-end-war" mrfobservableid="a4155b80-0e54-465c-80a0-acc4ba982bdd" target="_blank"><u>leave our legal territories</u></a>,” he said.</p>

Tomorrow’s talks wouldn’t be happening unless the Trump administration broke a whole load of Ukrainian and European eggshells to get to this point.</p>

<p data-role="headline">And <em>Responsible Statecraft </em>continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p data-role="headline"><strong>The biggest issue now is territory</strong></p>

<p>Even though he was wrongly derided at the time by mainstream <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="12" data-mrf-link="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media/" mrfobservableid="677c1fe1-4135-4423-a611-ac52fc6c1fac">media</a>, <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="13" data-mrf-link="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/22/europe/witkoff-carlson-trump-russia-ukraine-talks-intl/index.html" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/22/europe/witkoff-carlson-trump-russia-ukraine-talks-intl/index.html" mrfobservableid="2346bfa4-2f29-4846-9d4c-32b76b884df8" target="_blank"><u>Steve Witkoff</u></a> correctly pointed out in his March interview with Tucker Carlson that the territorial issues in Ukraine will be most intractable. Russia’s decision in October 2022 to formally annex the four oblasts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk changed the calculus. However, Russia does not have full territorial control of any of those oblasts, which are cut through the middle by a hotly contested front line.</p>

<p>Resolving the line of control when the war ends is, by some margin, the most problematic challenge. This will be a hugely sensitive topic, and European allies will shoot down any major concessions to Russia, as they did when the idea surfaced that the U.S.might <em>de jure</em> recognise Russia’s occupation of <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="14" data-mrf-link="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/25/world/trump-ukraine-crimea-explainer-intl/index.html" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/25/world/trump-ukraine-crimea-explainer-intl/index.html" mrfobservableid="56291079-0b2c-4e75-9089-cf4666fe1976" target="_blank"><u>Crimea</u></a>.</p>

<p>The most obvious settlement is a de facto recognition of occupation, a Cyprus-style scenario, that does not stand in the way of Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union. Even that will require detailed agreement on issues around demilitarization of the line of control and enforcing any ceasefire.</p>

<p data-role="headline"><strong>Sanctions are probably tricky, but also tractable</strong></p>

<p>As <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="15" data-mrf-link="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/lift-sanctions-on-russia/" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/lift-sanctions-on-russia/" mrfobservableid="85112044-af09-4c22-bae0-d5ebd31c0d41" target="_self"><u>I have said before</u></a>, there is enormous scope to a plan that allows for the immediate lifting of the bulk of zero-impact measures, phasing out the remainder at points agreed to by both sides. The toughest issue remains the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, mostly held in Belgium. Russia has shown a <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="16" data-mrf-link="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-the-status-of-russias-frozen-sovereign-assets/#:~:text=Reuters%20reported%20in%20February%20that%20Russia%20was%20prepared,some%20of%20the%20money%20goes%20to%20Russian-controlled%20Ukraine." href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-the-status-of-russias-frozen-sovereign-assets/#:~:text=Reuters%20reported%20in%20February%20that%20Russia%20was%20prepared,some%20of%20the%20money%20goes%20to%20Russian-controlled%20Ukraine." mrfobservableid="01ee7ccc-02d0-4916-8d02-e7662c7a6d5d" target="_blank"><u>willingness to concede</u></a> this funding to support reconstruction in Ukraine, including those parts that Russia occupies.</p>

<p>But there is texture here. Freeing up those funds for reconstruction would immediately remove the source of interest payments that are meeting Ukraine’s obligations on its $50 billion in <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="17" data-mrf-link="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/russian-assets-ukraine/" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/russian-assets-ukraine/" mrfobservableid="ed969ba1-cdf5-46c3-b1a5-cf44dc73da91" target="_self"><u>debt to the G7</u></a>, agreed to in June 2024. But the more general policy question arises, how much of the freed up funding would be spent in Ukraine itself and how much in Russian-occupied Ukraine, where most of the war damage has occurred? The U.S. must keep the pressure on to ensure the talks stay on track.</p>

<p>A U.S. presence in Istanbul will be vital, to prevent, in particular, Ukraine from bailing on the talks. That’s why sending <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="18" data-mrf-link="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/politics/government/trump-envoys-witkoff-and-kellogg-to-go-to-turkey-for-russia-ukraine-talks-sources-say/ar-AA1EGS2H?ocid=BingNewsSerp" href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/politics/government/trump-envoys-witkoff-and-kellogg-to-go-to-turkey-for-russia-ukraine-talks-sources-say/ar-AA1EGS2H?ocid=BingNewsSerp" mrfobservableid="9950f75a-e28f-4fcd-a2d6-b803d1003d5f" target="_blank"><u>Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg</u></a> makes sense. The former is trusted by the Russian side while the latter has built relationships in Ukraine. Their presence serves to keep the process moving forward until a deal can be pushed over the line and the fighting can stop.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the 2022 talks ran for a month and a half and the circumstances have materially changed as I have indicated above. While there has been speculation that <a cmp-ltrk="Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="19" data-mrf-link="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/trump-thinking-of-going-to-turkey-for-proposed-zelenskyy-putin-peace-talks/ar-AA1EEHH9?ocid=BingNewsSerp" href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/trump-thinking-of-going-to-turkey-for-proposed-zelenskyy-putin-peace-talks/ar-AA1EEHH9?ocid=BingNewsSerp" mrfobservableid="7e194de6-67c6-4aa6-9527-d1688fd049a0" target="_blank"><u>President Trump</u></a> might drop into Istanbul, I am not sure that this is necessary if President Putin doesn’t himself attend. Knowing the Russians, I assess that Putin will want his own “‘meeting moment” with the U.S. President on terms that the Russian side can better choreograph. Indeed, that may be a prize for Russia’s engagement in the process, given its desire for a more comprehensive reset of relations with the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>The Department of Justice urged the Supreme Court on May 13 to let the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have access to Social Security data after lower courts blocked that access.</strong></p>

Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02005/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency">issued</a> Executive Order 14158 on Jan. 20, implementing DOGE, an advisory body that recommends cost-cutting measures. The order directed the entity to “implement the President’s DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.”</p>

<p><strong>Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new filing that the lower courts have overreached and are attempting to turn themselves into “the human resources department for the Executive Branch.”</strong></p>

<p>The filing came after Ellen Lipton Hollander, a Maryland-based federal district court judge, issued an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.49.0.pdf">order</a> on March 20 preventing DOGE from viewing Social Security Administration (SSA) records because such access “violates” the federal Privacy Act.</p>

<p><strong>The lawsuit was brought in February by labor unions and retirees represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation.</strong></p>

<p>“The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,” the judge wrote in granting a temporary restraining order against the federal government.</p>

<p>DOGE’s team at the Social Security Administration has had “unbridled access to the personal and private data of millions of Americans, including but not limited to Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, hospitalization records, drivers’ license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income history, work history, birth and marriage certificates, and home and work addresses,” Hollander wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Hollander directed DOGE to delete any personally identifiable data in its possession. </strong>On April 17, Hollander <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/federal-judge-limits-doge-access-to-social-security-data-5843929">upgraded</a> the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>On April 30, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9–6 to maintain Hollander’s order while the appeal process continues.</p>

<p>On May 2, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-doge-access-to-social-security-data-5851531">filed</a> an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, asking the justices to pause the preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>In the May 13 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1063/358729/20250513153432172_SSA%20v.%20AFSCME%20%20-%20Stay%20Application%20Reply%20-%20Final.pdf">filing</a>, Sauer argued that the district court erred in preventing “the 11 members of the Social Security Administration (SSA) DOGE team—from accessing data ... for purposes that are unquestionably lawful.”</p>

<p>The district court “dictated to the Executive Branch which government employees can access which data and even prescribed necessary training, background checks, and paperwork for data access,” Sauer wrote.</p>

<p>“<strong>When district courts attempt to transform themselves into the human resources department for the Executive Branch, the irreparable harm to the government is clear</strong>,” he wrote.</p>

<p>When the courts “stymie the government’s initiatives to modernize badly outdated systems and combat rampant fraud—leaving those initiatives on a litigation track that may halt them for months or years—the irreparable harm is even clearer.”</p>

<p>Reviewing Social Security Administration data is important because the agency has “one of the largest documented histories of improper payments,” Sauer stated.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1063/358633/20250512154859924_AFSCME%20v%20SSA%20Opposition%20to%20Stay.pdf">brief</a> in opposition filed on May 12, the lead respondent, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, said that after years of honoring “its data security obligations,” the Social Security Administration “now seeks to throw open its data systems to unauthorized (and often unvetted) personnel who have no demonstrated need for the personally identifiable information ... they seek.”</p>

<p>The April 17 preliminary injunction should be left in place because it is “narrow and, contrary to the government’s assertions, permits SSA to disclose both anonymized and non-anonymized data to DOGE Team members,” the brief said.</p>

<p><strong>The Supreme Court could rule on the government’s emergency application at any time.</strong></p>

Title: Why Is The Secret German Spy Report On The AfD Party Only Filled With Public Statements?
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Why Is The Secret German Spy Report On The AfD Party Only Filled With Public Statements?</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://rmx.news/article/why-is-the-secret-german-spy-report-on-the-afd-party-only-filled-with-public-statements/">Via Remix News,</a></em></p>

<p>The German domestic spy service, the Office of the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), has released a 1,100-page report on the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which it used to label the party a “confirmed” right-wing extremist party. The report is huge and reads like it was written by Antifa, but that was to be expected. <strong>However, one interesting point is that it contains only public statements, including quotes made by AfD politicians and a lot of<a href="https://x.com/jonasgreindberg/status/1922764456985231822"> memes</a>.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/20250515_RMX_02.jpg?itok=AfveXFCG" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/20250515_RMX_02.jpg?itok=AfveXFCG"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9a680130-db39-4377-b1d6-7a34c383a589" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/20250515_RMX_02.jpg?itok=AfveXFCG" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p>

<p>We already know that the BfV is secretly surveilling AfD members in certain German states, mostly in the east, where the party is “confirmed right-wing extremist” already. This designation allows for the BfV in those states to partake in extraordinary surveillance powers over AfD members, including reading their chats and emails. Presumably, they can also track their browsing history, and perhaps they are even listening in on their conversations at home.</p>

<p>What this means is that the BfV has plenty of statements, memes and content to use based on <em>private statements</em>, but it is purposefully choosing not to use them. After all, a certain number of those AfD members, in private moments, probably also express opinions, post memes, or share thoughts that the BfV would love to include in a secret report on the party, which many hope will eventually justify an outright ban.</p>

<p><strong>Again, why is the BfV not using these private statements?</strong></p>

<p>There are multiple reasons.</p>

<p><strong>For one, a big part of the apparatus of spy agencies is to obtain information, but not release it to the public.</strong> The public may not be able to stomach such personal and private information and the means that were used to obtain it. Since the Edward Snowden revelations, and even before then, we have become acutely aware that we have accepted devices into our lives and homes that can be used to spy on us on a scale never seen before in history. However, even now — even after all this information has been revealed — I believe nearly all of us still cannot quite grasp what this means — nor do we want to.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, we know that AfD members are being spied on across Germany. Their emails are read, their phone calls are recorded. </strong>AI is being used to sort out keywords of interest to the security services. However, nobody really knows how this information is being processed and what it is being used for, or even who is reading it. The spies who control this information have extraordinary power. As a significant portion of them are now far left, at least in Germany, they believe they are acting as a bulwark against the rise of Nazism, and the ends justify the means when it comes to the AfD. There are other psychological motives at work, of course, as spy agencies are on the whole very good at keeping their secrets, not even necessarily because of internal controls, but because the spies are dedicated to their mission. There is, also, the sense of power that comes with being the watcher, and for many spies, this is a powerful intoxicant. They know, while you are in the dark.</p>

<p><strong>In practice, these spies know which AfD members are having affairs, their personal struggles, their health issues, their financial situation, and even their personal browsing history.</strong> In other words, they know their targets better in many cases than even their close friends and family. The spies of the world, not just in Germany, are now in many ways gods and mind readers, seeing through the walls people build up around themselves and accessing their darkest fears and secrets — all due to rapid advances in technology and the rise of smartphones.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier this month, commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek, the famed Dutch activist reported that she was alerted that her phone was being breached with Pegasus-like spyware, </strong>mainly produced in Israel, which can unlock essentially every aspect of her personal life, including chats, location data, photos, contacts, and so on. With this software, they can even record her in real time, including personal conversations in her home, as well as turn on her camera to record her in her most personal moments.</p>

— Eva Vlaardingerbroek (@EvaVlaar) <a href="https://twitter.com/EvaVlaar/status/1920160052239089964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>This software, and software like it, has been used on thousands of people, including journalists, politicians, and activists, sometimes with deadly results. </strong>It is not just the right, but far-left activists have also been targeted, including human rights activists. It is also unclear how long Vlaardingerbroek may have been targeted in such a manner. Previous versions of Apple iOS may have not been able to detect this software on her phone. In short, much of her personal life may already be in a database somewhere waiting to be used by intelligence.</p>

<p>Vlaardingerbroek is not in the AfD or even German, but she has backed the party, and she and people like her are most certainly the target of intelligence operatives in countries across Europe.</p>

<p>The point is that this software and the means for surveilling people are very unsettling.<strong> In a privacy-minded country like Germany, revealing the scale of surveillance being used against the AfD may be a scandal within itself, and could taint the entire report, which at the end of the day, should be used to justify a ban of the AfD.</strong></p>

<p>There may have been voices in the BfV who were calling to use secretly recorded data in the report as well, but the agency also knew this report would eventually be leaked and made public. The agency does not appear to want to divulge who they are surveilling, what information they have about them, and how they obtained this information.</p>

<p>Another important consideration is also to be taken into account. The BfV decided it did not need to include this secret information in the report because it is likely confident that it can get what it wants using public statements alone. It can still keep the scale of its surveillance secret and get the ban it desires — at least that is the gamble the agency is making.</p>

<p><strong>Surveillance is everywhere, it is being practiced by the left, the right, and many foreign governments are also active in the West, collecting data on targets.</strong> So, this is not a uniquely German issue by any means. However, if the establishment in Germany becomes truly desperate, there is probably a secret report waiting that includes far more information and personal details than many Germans want to believe is possible.</p>

Title: AWS to Azure Migration: A Cloudy Journey of Challenges and Triumphs
Description: <p><span data-contrast="auto" lang="EN-IN">So, you are considering migrating your infrastructure from AWS to Azure? Congratulations! You have officially joined the ranks of people who thought a simple cloud swap was a quick weekend project — and now you’re probably questioning your life choices. But don’t worry, it is not as crazy as it sounds. In fact, it can be a pretty smooth ride if you know what you’re getting into (or at least, if you have a strong coffee supply).</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto" lang="EN-IN">The cloud wars are heating up. AWS has been the big player for years, and Azure has been right there, lurking, always trying to steal the spotlight. But sometimes, you realize the place you have been renting is just not quite the right fit anymore. Maybe AWS is too complicated. Or maybe Azure just offers a few things that AWS cannot (no, really, it happens). Whatever the reason, migrating from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/aws-vs-azure-which-is-better-for-cloud-computing"><span data-contrast="auto" lang="EN-IN">AWS to Azure</span></a><span data-contrast="auto" lang="EN-IN">&nbsp;is not something to shy away from — unless, of course, you have something else to do like binge-watch an entire season of your favorite show.&nbsp;</span></p>

Title: Detection and Mitigation of Lateral Movement in Cloud Networks
Description: <h2 style="text-align: left;">How Hackers Bypass Lateral Movement Detection (And How to Stop Them)</h2>
<p>Detecting lateral movement has emerged as a crucial cybersecurity challenge today. Attackers who breach network perimeters follow a five-step process. They start with reconnaissance, move to their original compromise, spread laterally, establish persistence, and finally achieve their objectives. This systematic approach lets them quietly move through systems while they hunt for sensitive data and expand their control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security teams must understand hackers' techniques to spot lateral movement quickly. Attackers commonly use pass-the-hash attacks, remote execution, privilege escalation, Kerberoasting, and targeted phishing campaigns. Traditional security measures struggle to stop these sophisticated lateral movement techniques. Most organizations only spot breaches after attackers have caused substantial damage.</p>

Title: Optimizing Integration Workflows With Spark Structured Streaming and Cloud Services
Description: <p dir="ltr">Data is everywhere and moving faster than ever before. If you are processing logs from millions of IoT devices, tracking customer behavior on an e-commerce site, or monitoring stock market changes in real time, your ability to integrate and process this data quickly and efficiently can mean the difference between your business succeeding or failing.</p>
<p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/spark-structured-streaming-using-java">Spark Structured Streaming</a> comes in handy here. The combination of scalability offered by cloud services and the ability to handle real-time data streams makes it a powerful tool for optimizing integration workflows. Let's see how these two technologies can be used to design robust, high-performing data pipelines and how to deal with the actual world scenario of dealing with continuous data.</p>

Title: Designing a Java Connector for Software Integrations
Description: <p>IT systems need integration to achieve seamless data flow alongside enhanced operational efficiency. The expansion of businesses creates independent operational systems that restrict performance through object isolation and restrict time-sensitive information acquisition. The system's functions become oriented for better workflow coordination, which minimizes both repetition and creates unified operations.</p>
<p>The creation of such connections necessitates comprehensive knowledge about technical and business needs, which include format patterns along with protocol standards. Java provides robust libraries alongside <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/top-5-java-frameworks-for-web-application-developm">outstanding frameworks</a> that lead organizations to choose Java when building scalable, customized solutions. A strategically developed connector fulfills present requirements while enabling future technology adjustments, thus becoming a sustainable factor that supports successful IT system integration.</p>

Title: Integration Isn’t a Task — It’s an Architectural Discipline
Description: <p dir="ltr">Let’s talk about integration. Not the glossy vendor slide-deck version, but the messy, deeply architectural reality of connecting systems in the enterprise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite all our advances in tooling and frameworks, the way many organizations approach integration still hasn’t changed. Too often, we default to short-term fixes — point-to-point links, overstuffed middleware, or bespoke connectors — because they’re “fast.” But that speed comes at a price: brittle systems, tight coupling, and long-term technical debt that can paralyze change.</p>

Title: Vibe Coding With GitHub Copilot: Optimizing API Performance in Fintech Microservices
Description: <p style="text-align: left;">In fintech, APIs power everything. Starting from payments to trading to real-time customer experiences, the API takes care of everything. Performance isn't optional, but it's critical for user trust and business success.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a fintech API and cloud optimization expert, I constantly face the challenge of balancing quick development with high performance. When Microsoft announced GitHub Copilot for free, I asked myself a real-world question:<em>&nbsp;Can GitHub Copilot go beyond writing boilerplate code and help optimize fintech Microservice APIs?</em></p>

Title: Memory Leak Due to Time-Taking finalize() Method
Description: <p>All objects in Java implicitly inherit from <code>java.lang.Object</code>. This class contains multiple methods, which can be overridden in the child class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such overridable method is <code>finalize()</code>. Before objects get garbage collected from memory, the JVM will execute the <code>finalize()</code>. So, if you need to close any resources that were opened in the class (like backend connections, Files…), it can be done in this method.&nbsp;</p>

Title: Customer 360: Fraud Detection in Fintech With PySpark and ML
Description: <p>Every bank uses Customer 360 to maintain its customer records in a unified way, and it can also be used for fraud detection.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">What Is Customer 360?</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/integrating-customer-360-systems-with-gpt-apis-a-t">Customer 360</a> is like creating a complete picture of a customer by pulling together all the data you have about them — think of it as a "comprehensive profile." Imagine a bank with data from accounts, transactions, and customer service calls. Instead of having &nbsp;different/diverse data of the same customer, Customer 360 links them to say, “ This data in various ways belongs to customer John Doe.” It helps businesses understand customers better, personalize services, and figure out customer data patterns.</p>

Title: Mastering Advanced Aggregations in Spark SQL
Description: <p>In data analytics, efficiently aggregating large datasets is a basic need. For example, when working with retail inventory data, tracking products shipped to stores each month, the standard GROUP BY clause in SQL can handle basic aggregations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it falls short when you need multiple levels of aggregation in a single query. This is where <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/apache-spark-all-you-need-to-know">Spark SQL’s</a> advanced GROUP BY extensions, GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, and CUBE, come into the picture to compute multiple groupings efficiently.</p>

Title:  鲍威尔：将重新评估2020版货币政策框架的“关键部分”，长期利率可能走高，“供应冲击”或成新常态 
Description:  <p>在周四的讲话中，美联储主席鲍威尔明确表示正在重新评估其货币政策框架的“关键部分”，包括通胀目标和就业“缺口”的处理方式。随着经济和政策不断变动，长期利率可能会走高。</p>
<p>鲍威尔表示，较高的实际利率可能反映了未来通胀可能比2010年代间歇期更加波动的可能性，称“供应冲击”将“更频繁且可能更持久”，这对经济和央行来说是一个困难的挑战。然而，华尔街日报知名记者、“新美联储通讯社”Nick Timiraos认为，这实际上与美联储目前设定利率的方式关系不大。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f817ea45-3ed7-4d23-adac-fbdaf141ac95.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="553" data-wscnw="737"/></p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="3e99817d">2020年框架已不适用</h2>
</div>
<p>当地时间周四，鲍威尔在美联储托马斯·劳巴赫(Thomas Laubach)研究会议上表示，美联储正在调整其货币政策框架，以应对2020年疫情后通胀和利率前景的重大变化。</p>
<p>他表示，2020年制定的政策框架是基于当时持续低利率和低通胀的环境，但当下经济条件已发生显著变化。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们将确保新的共识声明能够适应广泛的经济环境和发展。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>特别值得注意的是，鲍威尔明确指出“零利率下限约束不再是基础情景。”他表示，2020年疫情之后，通胀调整后的“实际”利率上升，可能会影响美联储当前框架的要素。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>较高的实际利率可能反映出通胀在未来可能比21世纪10年代危机间期更加不稳定的可能性。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1d9eca57">重新评估“缺口”概念：不再过度关注就业</h2>
<p>2020年框架将美联储的就业目标重点放在所谓的“缺口”上——即失业率过高的时期。这一变化实际上减少了美联储提前加息以冷却劳动力市场和防止通胀压力出现的做法。</p>
<p>鲍威尔周四解释说，这一调整并非永久放弃预防性政策举措或忽视劳动力市场紧张状况。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>它表明，表面上的劳动力市场紧张本身不足以触发政策反应，除非委员会认为如果不加以控制，将导致不受欢迎的通胀压力。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ce4778e">重新考虑“灵活平均通胀目标”</h2>
<p>2020年框架审查后，美联储采用了“灵活平均通胀目标”方法，允许通胀在长期低于2%后适度超过2%一段时间。批评者认为，这一框架过于针对当时的低利率、低通胀环境，并不适用于疫情后的经济状况。</p>
<p>对此，鲍威尔在演讲中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>在我们的讨论中，与会者已表示他们认为重新考虑关于“缺口”的表述是合适的。在上周的会议上，我们对平均通胀目标也有类似的看法。</p>
<p>实际利率上升也可能反映出，未来通胀可能会比2010年代两次危机之间的时期更加波动。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>尽管框架正在修订，但鲍威尔重申了2%通胀目标的重要性：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>锚定预期对我们所做的一切至关重要，今天我们仍然完全致力于2%的目标。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>长期利率可能走高，“供应冲击”或成新常态</h2>
<p>鲍威尔特别警告道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们可能正在进入一个供应冲击更频繁、更持久的时期——这对经济和央行来说都是一个艰巨的挑战。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这些关于“供应冲击”的言论与鲍威尔最近几周发表的警告相似，他曾多次提到政策变化可能使美联储陷入支持就业和控制通胀之间的艰难平衡。虽然鲍威尔在今天的讲话中没有提到特朗普的关税，但他最近已经指出，关税可能会减缓经济增长并推高通胀。</p>
<p>鲍威尔还表示，框架审查将关注沟通方式：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>在冲击更大、更频繁或更分散的时期，有效沟通要求我们传达围绕我们对经济和前景理解的不确定性。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timiraos分析认为，<strong>此次评估不太可能影响美联储目前设定利率的方式。</strong>鲍威尔表示，新框架将在“未来几个月”完成，这可能意味着他将在怀俄明州杰克逊霍尔(Jackson Hole)举行的美联储年度研讨会上概述这一政策。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<h2 id="eb84d88c">企业陷入定价两难困境</h2>
</div>
<p>数据表明，美国制造商和服务提供商目前正在避免将更高的美国进口关税传递给下游。尽管生产商正在感受到进口材料和其他投入品的激进关税带向，但对消费者的影响仍然温和。</p>
<p>商业领导者正在苦恼如何在不断变化的政策环境中最大程度地降低更高关税的影响。亚特兰大联邦储备银行最新的商业通胀预期调查显示，不到五分之一的企业表示，他们能够完全转嫁10%的成本增加。</p>
<p>一些企业一直在吸收部分额外成本，以避免在消费者对经济已感到不安的时期需求回落。消费者信心已经下滑，而周四发布的另一份报告显示，零售销售几乎没有增长。</p>
<p>汽车制造商Stellantis NV正在对其车辆提供折扣，而现代汽车公司则将价格保持稳定至6月。这些定价行动表明，一些最大的汽车制造商正试图缓解人们对进口汽车关税将使价格上涨数千美元的担忧。</p>
<p>同时，其他零售商预计购物者将经历更高的价格。沃尔玛在交付了一个销售和收入增长强劲的季度后，警告称关税和日益动荡的经济环境意味着该零售商预计将从本月开始提高一些价格。</p>
<p>对于正在提高价格的公司而言，这样做的风险是可能导致销售额下降。然而，不这样做则会对利润率构成风险。许多公司也在寻求其他方式削减成本或努力提高生产率。</p>

<li>Sam&#39;s Club同店销售增长6.7%，交易量增长4.8%。会员收入增长9.6%，会员数量、续约率和Plus会员均实现稳健增长。</li>
<li>全球广告收入增长50%（包括新收购的VIZIO），美国本土的Walmart Connect广告业务增长31%（不含VIZIO）。</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>沃尔玛维持了2026财年的年度销售和利润预测不变。</strong>公司继续预计截至2026年1月的财年调整后每股收益在2.50美元至2.60美元之间，年销售额增长在3%至4%之间。同时，预计第二季度合并净销售额增长在3.5%至4.5%之间，高于市场预期的3.46%。</p>
<p>作为美国最大的集装箱货物进口商，沃尔玛的财报一直被视为了解美国消费者健康状况和关税政策经济波动影响的重要窗口。沃尔玛CEO Doug McMillon在财报电话会议中直言：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;我们将尽最大努力保持低价，但考虑到关税的规模，即使是本周宣布的降低后的水平，考虑到零售业利润微薄的现实，我们也无法吸收所有压力。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFO John David Rainey在接受采访时表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“目前零售业的经营环境充满挑战，价格上涨如此之快。历史上没有先例能与如此高、如此快的价格上涨相比。关税增加的幅度如此之大，零售商无法自行吸收这些成本。”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>美国区：核心市场展现超强韧性</h2>
<p>作为公司最重要的市场，<strong>沃尔玛美国区表现强势，销售额达1122亿美元，同比增长3.2%，可比销售增长4.5%。</strong>尤为突出的是，健康与保健以及杂货类别表现出色，促使美国区运营利润增长7.0%至57亿美元。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/48cb0259-b1d0-4008-b696-f3818e00dfe8.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="450" data-wscnw="1457"/></p>
<p>沃尔玛比其他零售商更有能力应对各种挑战。<strong>公司的全球供应链使其能够从多个地区采购产品，而其规模意味着它可以与供应商谈判更好的交易条件。</strong></p>
<p>作为低价格的代名词，沃尔玛通常在经济困难时期表现良好，<strong>因为人们会倾向于寻求优惠。</strong>其数字化运营也给沃尔玛带来了优势。该零售商正通过其取货和配送服务吸引更多顾客，并吸引更多高收入购物者购买杂货、感冒药和婴儿产品等。</p>
<p>沃尔玛国际业务销售额298亿美元，按固定汇率计算增长7.8%，但运营利润下降17.5%至12.6亿美元。这一下滑主要是由于公司对Flipkart、Walmex和加拿大市场的战略性增长投资所致。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e01d097f-6f67-4c3f-a776-01422ede3ffd.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="177" data-wscnw="870"/></p>
<h2>挑战与展望：经济不确定性下的前景</h2>
<p><strong>除了传统的零售业务外，沃尔玛正加速发展高利润率的数字业务</strong>，包括广告、会员服务和电商平台。这些业务不仅增长迅速，而且利润率远高于传统零售业务。</p>
<p>分析指出，美国消费者信心4月份连续第四个月下滑，表明消费者购买谨慎；与此同时，美国GDP在第一季度三年来首次收缩，引发了对经济衰退的担忧。在这种环境下，<strong>沃尔玛以日常低价策略销售必需品和杂货的定位虽然给公司带来了竞争优势，但也使其利润率维持在较低水平。</strong></p>
<p>CFO John David Rainey强调，鉴于当前经济环境的动态性和短期结果预测范围过于宽泛，公司选择不为第二季度提供特定的运营利润增长和EPS指引，但预计第二季度净销售额将增长3.5%-4.5%。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  恒瑞医药启动港股全球招股，近五年港股最大医药IPO来袭 
Description:  <p>2025年5月15日，A股创新药龙头企业恒瑞医药（600276.SH）正式启动H股全球公开发售，计划发行224,519,800股H股（假设超额配售权及发售量调整权未行使），发行价区间定为每股41.45-44.05港元。若全额行使超额配售权及发售量调整权，发行H股最高达296,927,200股，最高募资额可达130.8亿港元，这将成为近五年港股医药企业IPO最高募资额。</p>
<h2><strong>发行细节：时间紧凑，豪华基石团队加持</strong></h2>
<p>据了解，恒瑞医药H股香港公开发售将于5月20日结束，预计于22日前确定最终发行价，最快或于5月23日正式登陆港交所主板，实现&#34;A+H&#34;两地上市。此次发行由摩根士丹利、花旗及华泰国际担任联席保荐人。</p>
<p>值得关注的是，恒瑞医药此次IPO吸引了一众&#34;豪华基石投资天团&#34;的参与，包括新加坡政府投资公司（GIC）、景顺（Invesco）、瑞银全球资产管理集团（UBS-GAM）、高瓴资本、博裕资本等。据招股书，基石投资者按发售价认购或促使其指定实体认购可购入的若干数目的发售股份，以发行价中端计算，总金额逾41亿港元（5.33亿美元），认购金额占比达发行规模的43.04%（假设超额配售权及发售量调整权未行使）。</p>
<p>这些投资巨头的加持不仅彰显了国际资本对恒瑞医药的信心，也将在未来业务发展中起到重要作用。GIC作为全球最大主权财富基金之一，其国际视野和资源网络将有助于恒瑞拓展全球市场；景顺和UBS-GAM作为全球资产管理巨头，将提升恒瑞在国际投资者中的认可度；高瓴资本和博裕资本在医疗健康领域的深厚经验和产业资源，则有望为恒瑞的创新研发和商业化提供支持。</p>
<h2><strong>为何登陆港股？国际化战略的关键一步</strong></h2>
<p>赴香港上市对于恒瑞医药而言极为重要，是其出海战略的关键一步。首先，香港资本市场的国际投资者基础广泛，有助于提升公司在全球医药行业的品牌影响力。其次，本次上市可进一步优化资本结构并开拓新的融资渠道，为公司多元化融资提供助力。再者，上市有助于公司拓展海外业务和国际研发合作，增强国际布局，进一步实现海外市场的突破，提升公司的全球竞争力。</p>
<p>恒瑞医药的财务表现持续强劲。2024年，公司实现营业收入279.85亿元，同比增长22.63%；归属于上市公司股东的净利润63.37亿元，同比增长47.28%。2025年一季度，公司继续保持强劲增长势头，实现营业收入72.06亿元，同比增长20.14%；归属于上市公司股东的净利润18.74亿元，同比增长36.90%。公司研发投入同样可观，2024年累计研发投入82.28亿元，占销售收入比重达到29.40%，自2011年至今累计研发投入达460亿元。</p>
<h2><strong>折价19.3%发行</strong></h2>
<p>以恒瑞定价区间最高的44.05港元每股计算，对比过去十日的A股平均股价，H股发行价存在19.3%的折让。即使如此，恒瑞此次定价相较石药、中国生物制药等H股上市老牌药企，仍有明显的估值溢价。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e9ec0841-95e7-42bf-8e28-3075d0049770.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="670" data-wscnw="1096"/></p>
<p>据wind数据，相较于过往医药行业6家募资额较大的A+H上市公司平均27.4%的折价，仍然映射出资本市场对于医药龙头的认可，同时也体现了恒瑞医药对自身价值的信心以及对未来市场发展的积极预期。</p>
<p>所得募集资金在扣除发行费用后，将用于研发计划；在中国和海外市场建设新的生产和研发设施，及扩大或升级在中国的现有生产设施；营运资金及其他一般企业用途等。</p>
<p>在全球创新药竞争日益激烈的背景下，恒瑞医药借助港股上市扩大国际影响力，进一步巩固其在中国创新药企业中的领军地位，同时加速国际化进程。对于中国创新药企业而言，这将是一个标志性事件，或将为更多有国际化雄心的中国药企提供借鉴。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title: Revolutionize textile recycling | Science
Description: The rapid rise in textile waste worldwide has brought growing attention to the environmental consequences of fast fashion. In 2015, the global textiles and clothing industry generated an estimated 92 million metric tons of waste (1), and projections suggest that this figure could increase by at least 50% by 2030 under a business-asusual scenario (2). Unsustainable waste management practices, such as landfilling, have exacerbated environmental challenges, contributing to the release of micro- and nanoplastics as well as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into ecosystems (3, 4). The textile industry urgently needs sustainable interventions that will promote a circular economy.

剛提出時34%的水平，再疊加因芬太尼問題加徵的20%，總稅率或維持在54%；中國則可能同步將對美關稅降至34%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">然而5月12日公佈的《中美日內瓦經貿會談聯合聲明》帶來超出預期——美國不僅撤回了4月2日之後實施的多輪累計91%的報復性關稅，還將4月2日設定的34%「對等關稅」 中的24%暫停執行90天，實際生效的 「對等關稅」 暫時降至10%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">作為回應，中國同步調整稅委會公告，將對美加徵關稅從34%下調至10%，同樣暫停 24%的關稅措施。這意味著在90天緩衝期內，兩國關稅水平被大幅拉低至 「對等 10%」 的基準線，顯著緩解了此前劍拔弩張的貿易對峙氛圍。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">這就形成了中美關稅從「145%驟降至10%」的印象。但如果仔細測算，實際關稅其實非常高。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">除了基準層面保留10% 的 「對等關稅」

加徵的四輪關稅（前三輪25%、第四輪7.5%），但不是針對所有商品。美國智庫彼得森國際經濟研究所（PIIE）測算，2020年初美國對華平均加權關稅稅率為19.3%，但伴隨中國對美出口佔比下降以及出口商品類別調整，到2024年底加權平均關稅為10.7%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">這意味著，美國對華目前關稅大致為40.7%；投行高盛測算，再綜合各類調整及半導體等行業的關稅豁免美國對華實際有效關稅稅率為39%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">這也處在特朗普第一任期從未達到的高關稅水平。高盛認為，大幅39%的對華關稅，將拖累中國經濟增速減少0.8的百分點。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">在非關稅領域同樣也不是「壁壘全消」，中方暫停或取消了4月出台的7類中重稀土出口管制，但繼續維持2月實施的鎢、碲、鉍等關鍵礦物出口限制，以及2024年12月針對鎵、鍺、銻等兩用物項的管制措施。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">此外，美方「小額包裹」的關稅此前從「豁免」變為120%，5月14日聯合聲明後將變為54%，改為按價值或按件徵收（5月25美元 / 件，6 月起50美元 / 件），雖未直接影響大宗商品貿易，卻增加了跨境電商等細分領域的運營成本。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">ING銀行大中華區首席經濟師宋林向BBC中文表示，關稅降至目前水平，足以讓貿易基本回歸正常狀態——在這一水平，出口商、進口商和消費者將共同分擔關稅影響，整體商業活動有望恢復。回顧今年第一季度，20%-30%關稅水平下，對美出口同比增長約5%，儘管存在貿易提前囤貨的因素。</p></div><figure

ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">2018年其從中國進口半導體芯片價值38.8億美元，佔美國半導體芯片整體進口額的10.33%；2024年已經降至20.9億美元，份額降至4.49%。因此，2025年以來升至70%關稅的邊際影響相對有限。70%的稅率還在進一步壓低這一份額，今年3月，從中國進口的半導體金額約佔美國整體半導體進口額的3%-4%，相比去年同期未發生顯著變化。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">而受到影響的，不少是美國企業，比如AMD、英特爾、美光、三星等外資企業在中國完成部分工序回運美國加工、銷售，面臨著不小的額外成本支出。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">一位在深圳從事芯片業務的貿易商向BBC中文表示，過去幾年，中國輸美的芯片量已經很少了，以前中國在中低端芯片、傳感器，有成本優勢，美國在高端芯片有技術優勢，現在這兩種優勢都被打斷，沒法發揮出來。「未來90天內生意繼續做，馬照跑，就是訂單不一定會很激進，一個怕訂單太大風險太大，後續付款項也會有問題；一個怕下單太多，本地的需求下行而堵庫存。」</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">雖然對華芯片關稅還居高不下，但美國高端芯片的出口禁令正在鬆動。背後是特朗普和拜登的不同策略傾向——特朗普執著於貿易平衡，降低貿易赤字，拜登則執著於建「小院高牆」，聯合盟友圍堵中國。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">今年1月13日，即將卸任的美國前總統拜登發佈《人工智能擴散規則》，限制部分高算力的先進GPU的出口，而且限制範圍從過去的個別實體或國家，擴大到全世界，即無論出口到全球哪個國家，都將需要美國的許可，只是待遇不同——將全球劃分為：第一層級的17個國家及台灣可無限制獲得AI芯片；第二層級的約120個國家須遵守芯片數量上限；第三層級則將中國、俄羅斯、伊朗、朝鮮等列為禁區，完全禁止進口這些高端器件。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">該計劃原本會在5月15日正式生效，但就在中美談判後第二天，美國商務部下屬的工業與安全局（BIS）的副部長傑弗里·凱斯勒（Jeffery Kessler）表示，已指示BIS執法人員不要執行《人工智能擴散規則》，因為他不僅會扼殺美國的創新，還會給企業增加繁重的監管負擔，還可能將許多國家降為次級地位，破壞美國與這些國家的外交關係。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d

class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">中美在日內瓦經貿會談結束後，國際社會的目光迅速聚焦於談判成果對全球貿易格局的後續。作為美國傳統盟友的日本與歐盟，以及新興經濟體印度，分別以不同姿態回應這場牽動世界經濟神經的博弈。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">在亞洲，日本展現出謹慎而強硬的姿態。在中美發布聯合聲明的當天，日本首相石破茂在日本眾議院預算委員會會議上說，不能接受在不包含汽車領域的情況下與美方達成協議，也不會為了汽車產業而犧牲農業、以擴大進口美國大米作為談判籌碼。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">由於日本是美國的忠實盟友，這使得石破茂相對強硬的表態，引發關注和討論。日本財務省數據顯示，2024年日美貿易逆差達600多億美元，其中汽車及零部件佔逆差總額的 62%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">與此同時，美國總統特朗普在中美聯合聲明發佈數小時後，迅速將貿易戰的矛頭轉向歐洲。同樣是在中美髮布聯合聲明的當天，特朗普在白宮記者會上突然將矛頭轉向歐盟，宣稱「 歐盟在貿易上的做法比中國更惡劣」，並威脅將對歐盟汽車啓動 「301 調查」。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">這一言論立即引發歐盟委員會的強烈反應。歐盟委員會貿易發言人奧洛夫·吉爾（Olof Gill）表示，歐盟堅決反對任何不合理的貿易壁壘和單邊關稅措施，強調歐盟將採取一切必要手段保護自身企業和消費者的利益。他指出，歐盟始終主張通過對話和談判解決分歧，反對單邊主義，但絕不會容忍不公平的貿易做法。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">而在南亞次大陸，印度一直被美國視作在該區域制衡中國的盟友，但在特朗普的關稅攻擊中同樣「中槍」。中美聯合聲明發佈數小時後，印度常駐世界貿易組織（WTO）代表向爭端解決機構提交文件，擬對部分美國商品加徵報復性關稅，以此回應美國以「保障措施」為由對印度鋼鋁產品徵收的25%關稅。印度強調，這一反制措施旨在通過「實質等效」的貿易調整，平衡美方舉措造成的經濟損失。彭博社形容，這是印度首次提出反制美關稅政策的舉措。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">前美國財政部長勞倫斯·薩默斯（Lawrence Summers）在接受媒體採訪時表示，「很明顯，特朗普先眨眼了」，並認為中國在未改變核心政策的情況下迫使美國妥協，這一案例可能鼓勵其他國家在貿易談判中採取更堅定的立場。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">華盛頓戰略與國際研究中心（CSIS）專家菲利普·A·勒克（Philip A. Luck ）表示，美國政府曾警告貿易報復將帶來後果，但中國的反制使其實際關稅水平降回去了，這削弱了美國政府「能夠通過不斷升級獲勝」的立場，損害了美國的信譽。缺乏一致性和持續執行的威脅式貿易政策不僅無效，反而適得其反，危害美國的戰略目標和普通民眾利益。若未來政府為恢復信譽而盲目執行威脅，後果難料。</p></div></main><p><strong><a href="https://blockads.fivefilters.org">Adblock test</a></strong> <a href="https://blockads.fivefilters.org/acceptable.html">(Why?)</a></p>

Title: Hard data suggests tariff-driven inflation and recession fears may be overblown
Description: <p>With major <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/retail-sales-april-tariffs-consumers" target="_blank">indicators</a> from April — the month of peak tariff uncertainty — now in, none show the kinds of recessionary or inflationary conditions implied by business and consumer surveys.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Warnings and anecdotes are taking on greater importance as signs of how tariffs are working their way through the economy.</p><hr><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> New data out Thursday showed steady retail sales and a surprising drop in wholesale prices in April. So far, so good.</p><ul><li>But also Thursday morning, the country's largest retailer warned that it will not be able to absorb tariff-related price increases — even considering the trade war pullback announced earlier this week.</li><li>Walmart, known for its low prices, will pass some of those costs onto the consumer. If Walmart can't hold the line, it's hard to see how other retailers might be able to.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> "We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb," Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on Thursday.</p><ul><li>"It's more than any supplier can absorb. And so I'm concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You'll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June."</li></ul><p><strong>By the numbers:</strong> Retail sales rose by 0.1% in April, after a massive spending surge that was even stronger than initially reported. The control group, used to calculate personal consumption expenditures in GDP, fell by 0.2%.</p><ul><li>Retail sales rose by 1.7% in March, revised up by 0.2 percentage point. It was the biggest gain in two years as consumers rushed to purchase autos and other goods before tariff-related price increases.</li><li>The result was a pullback in most goods categories this month. Even so, there is some evidence that spending on services kept pace. Spending at restaurants and bars, among the few service-sector categories in the retail sales report, rose by 1.2% in April.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> The Producer Price Index, a gauge of wholesale prices, showed little sign of tariff-related price pressures that businesses have warned about.</p><ul><li>PPI fell by 0.5% in April after a flat reading in March, rounding out an upbeat inflation snapshot after the index's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/cpi-trump-tariffs-april-inflation-report" target="_blank">consumer</a> counterpart released Tuesday. </li><li>Goods prices were flat last month after falling almost a full percentage point in March. Services prices fell by 0.7%, the biggest drop since the index began in 2009.</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> "There is little evidence, so far, that tariffs are inflationary and instead profit margins are being squeezed. But as Walmart suggested Thursday morning, that is a situation that may not last long," ING chief international economist James Knightley wrote in a note. </p>

Title: Mapped: Birthright citizenship around the world

<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/10/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-action" target="_blank">birthright citizenship</a> is mostly a facet of the Western Hemisphere.</p><hr><ul><li>Many

Title: Consumers eased spending in April after tariff front-loading
Description: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/cpi-trump-tariffs-april-inflation-report" target="_blank">American consumers</a> slowed spending in April after a tariff-fueled purchasing boom, the <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html" target="_blank">Commerce Department said</a> on Thursday.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Shopping moderated notably after consumers <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/16/consumer-spending-march-tariffs-trump" target="_blank">front-loaded purchases</a> to get ahead of the effects of President Trump's trade war. </p><hr><p><strong>By the numbers:</strong> Retail sales rose by 0.1% in April after surging in March by 1.7%, a figure that the government said was higher than initially reported.</p><ul><li>Restaurants and bars were the big winner last month, as sales rose 1.2%, while home improvement stores saw sales rise 0.8%.</li><li>But most other retail categories saw a slowdown in spending relative to March, including hobby shops (-2.5%), miscellaneous shops (-2.1%) and department stores (-1.4%). </li><li>Sales at gasoline stations fell 0.5%, likely a result of prices falling at the pump.

Title: Trump tells Apple not to expand iPhone production in India
Description: <p>President Trump on Thursday said he told Apple not to expand <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/25/apple-ramps-up-india-plan-closer" target="_blank">iPhone production in India</a>, while also indicating the possibility of a sweeping new trade deal with the country. </p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Apple was reportedly planning to massively expand phone manufacturing for the U.S. market in India, as a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/apple-stock-tariffs-china-iphones" target="_blank">workaround</a> for the ongoing <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/12/china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs" target="_blank">trade war with China</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday, I said to him 'Tim you're my friend, I've treated you very good,'" Trump told a news conference in Qatar.</p><ul><li>"I don't want you building in India," Trump said he told Cook. </li><li>"I said to Tim, I said, 'Tim we've treated you really good, we put up with all the plants that you built in China for years ... we're not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves," Trump said.</li></ul><p><strong>Apple spokespeople</strong> were not immediately available for comment early Thursday morning.</p><ul><li>Apple shares were down 1% in early premarket trading. </li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>While speaking about Cook and Apple, Trump also noted that the U.S. was working on a trade deal that would purportedly involve India charging no tariffs on U.S. products.</p><ul><li>That would be a significant change from the status quo, as India has some of the highest levies on U.S. goods now.</li></ul><p><em>Editor's note: This is a developing story.

Title: Supreme Court weighs judges' power over Trump
Description: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">The Trump administration</a> will be fighting an uphill battle as it tries to persuade the Supreme Court to let more of President Trump's agenda take effect.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>The Justice Department will argue Thursday that lower courts should not be able to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/judges-rule-against-trump-doge-buyout" target="_blank">stand in the way</a> of Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship — or other executive actions.</p><hr><ul><li>Federal district courts have issued roughly 30 orders blocking the Trump administration from implementing <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/24/courts-hammer-trump-pm" target="_blank">major parts of its agenda</a>.</li><li>Three district courts have blocked <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/#:~:text=The%20Fourteenth%20Amendment%20states%3A%20%E2%80%9CAll,the%20State%20wherein%20they%20reside.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship</a> from taking effect. All three said their rulings applied not only to the specific cases before them, but to the entire policy, nationwide.</li><li>The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of those orders. The court hears oral arguments Thursday.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Nationwide injunctions from lower courts have become increasingly common since the Obama administration, and have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/23/trump-courts-injunctions" target="_blank">exploded under Trump</a>.</p><ul><li>There's a good-faith, non-ideological argument that courts are handing down too many of them. There are more than 600 district court judges in the U.S. — when all of them have the power to freeze a presidential policy, lawsuits can grind the presidency to a halt more easily than ever before.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> While Thursday's arguments are focused on how courts have handled birthright citizenship, the Justice Department has urged the justices to impose a broader crackdown on nationwide injunctions.</p><ul><li>"This Court should declare that enough is enough," the Justice Department <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A885/352045/20250313134644359_Trump%20v.%20Washington%20Application.pdf" target="_blank">said in a brief</a> to the high court.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> Even some skeptics of nationwide injunctions say this may not be the right case in which to curtail them.</p><ul><li>The blue states and advocacy organizations challenging Trump's executive order argue that the question of who's a U.S. citizen is an inherently national one.</li><li>Rolling back nationwide injunctions in these cases "would leave tens of thousands of infants born on U.S. soil undocumented, subject to removal or detention, and many stateless, even though they have done nothing wrong," they <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A885/354760/20250404111851793_24A885_PlaintiffStates_ResponseEmergencyStay.pdf" target="_blank">argued in a brief</a> to the court.</li></ul><p><strong>Every district court</strong> to consider Trump's order has said it's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/30/trump-supreme-court-spending-birthright-citizenship" target="_blank">likely unconstitutional</a>. And when those orders have been appealed, every appeals court has allowed nationwide injunctions to remain in place.</p><ul><li>That's evidence that the normal appeals process is working, the challengers argue, so there's no need for the Supreme Court to intervene.</li><li>Furthermore, the Supreme Court is more likely to take up constitutional questions when there's a disagreement among lower courts that only it can settle. There's no such division here.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>The case before the court this week isn't about the constitutional merits of Trump's policy, although judges consider the likely outcome of a case when deciding whether to issue injunctions.</p><ul><li>The 14th Amendment says: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."</li><li>That provision means that children born in the U.S. are citizens, even if their parents aren't, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/169us649" target="_blank">ruled in 1898</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>What we're watching:</strong> Some of the court's conservative justices have called for a crackdown on nationwide injunctions.</p><ul><li>Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas sharply criticized an injunction that froze Trump's plans to cut off funding for USAID, calling it an "act of judicial hubris."</li><li>Birthright citizenship presents different legal questions, and the procedural history of these cases is different.</li></ul><p><strong>Thursday's arguments</strong> should provide some indication of whether those four would still be united in this context — and, if so, whether they'd be able to persuade one more justice to join their cause.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Kennell Staten saw Walker Courts as his best path out of homelessness, he said. The complex had some of the only subsidized apartments he knew of in his adopted hometown of Jonesboro, Arkansas, so he applied to live there again and again. But while other people seemed to sail through the leasing process, his applications went nowhere. Staten thought he knew why: He is gay. The property manager had made her feelings about that clear to him, he said. “She said I was too flamboyant,” he remembered, “that it’s a whole bunch of older people staying there and they would feel uncomfortable seeing me coming outside with a dress or skirt on.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">So Staten filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in February. It was the type of complaint that HUD used to take seriously. The agency has devoted itself to rooting out prejudice in the housing market since the Fair Housing Act was signed into law in 1968, one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. And, following a <a href="https://www.fairhousingnc.org/newsletter/hud-announces-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-are-protected-by-federal-fair-housing-act/">2020 Supreme Court ruling</a> that declared that civil rights protections bar unequal treatment because of someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, HUD considered it illegal to discriminate in housing on those grounds.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">Then Donald Trump became president once more. Two days after filing his complaint, Staten received a letter informing him that HUD did not view allegations like his as subject to federal law — a stark departure from its position just a month prior. The news gutted him. “I went through pure hell just to get turned away,” Staten said. (The property manager disputed Staten’s account and said he was rejected for fighting on the property, which Staten denied. The property owner declined to comment.) </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">Staten’s complaint is one of hundreds impacted by a major retreat in the federal government’s decadeslong fight against housing discrimination and segregation, according to interviews with 10 HUD officials. Those federal staffers, along with state officials, attorneys and advocates across the country, described a dismantling of federal fair housing enforcement, which has been slowed, constrained or halted at every step. The investigative process has been hobbled. The agency is withholding discrimination charges that HUD officials say should already have been issued. Those accused of housing discrimination appear newly emboldened not to cooperate with the agency. And at least 115 federal fair housing cases have been halted or closed entirely since Trump took office, with hundreds more cases in jeopardy, HUD officials estimate. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.4">These changes raise questions about the future of one of the enduring legacies of the civil rights movement, which advocates see as urgently needed today amid a historic housing shortage and rising complaints about housing discrimination. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.5">“It’ll give free rein to companies, to states, to governments to take advantage of people, to refuse to respect their rights, without fear of response from the government. They know that no one is watching, no one will hold them accountable, so they can just do what they want,” said Paul Osadebe, a HUD attorney and union steward who litigates fair housing cases. “The civil rights laws that people marched for and fought for and died for, that Congress passed and at least sensibly expects to be enforced, that’s just not happening right now. It’s not happening. And people are really being harmed by it.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.6">Asked to comment on the findings in this story, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement: “HUD is committed to rooting out discrimination and upholding the Fair Housing Act. ProPublica continues to cherry pick examples to further an activist narrative rather than report the facts.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">For many victims of housing discrimination, HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has long been the best path to winning justice. Recent investigations by the office and its state and local partners have led to millions of dollars in relief for victims and reforms from landlords, mortgage lenders and local governments. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">When a California city began requiring property owners to evict tenants if the county sheriff’s department said they had engaged in criminal activity — regardless of whether they were convicted — it was a HUD investigation that led to a nearly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/united-states-v-city-hesperia-cd-cal">$1 million settlement</a> and a repeal of the ordinance. (The city did not admit liability.) The agency also secured a $300,000 settlement for a mother, daughter and the daughter’s boyfriend in Oklahoma who were allegedly <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/Cushing%20Housing_OPMI%20LOF%2010.26.22.pdf">harassed and assaulted</a> by neighbors because the boyfriend was Black, to which the landlord responded by trying to evict the mother. (A representative for the property ownership company said company leadership has changed since the allegations.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">Such victories may be rare in the next four years.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.3">“We are being gutted right now,” said one agency official, who, like others, requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “And it feels like it’s not even the beginning.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The Fair Housing Office’s staff of roughly 550 full-time employees is set to fall by more than a third through the administration’s federal worker buyout program, according to a HUD meeting recording obtained by ProPublica. Internal projections that have circulated widely among HUD staffers suggest far deeper cuts could follow.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">Those accused of housing discrimination seem to have taken notice. HUD officials described an increase in defendants ignoring correspondence from investigators or even copying Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency in their communication with HUD, seemingly in hopes the cost-cutting department will take their side.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">“For them to face a consequence, they will need to be brought through a litigation process, which requires expenditure of litigation from the department, and they know that we don’t have those resources anymore,” one HUD official said. “They also feel emboldened that this administration will not consider the things that they are doing to be illegal.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.3">Some defendants have been more explicit about this. In one case, a midwestern city — which had allegedly allowed local politicians to block affordable housing in white neighborhoods — asked HUD officials if the agency still had the backing to pursue the case if the city walked away from the negotiating table, one official said. In another case, a public housing authority, also in the Midwest, rescinded a six-figure settlement it had offered two days prior, citing Trump’s newly issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-equality-of-opportunity-and-meritocracy/">executive order</a> attacking “disparate-impact liability.” The housing authority had allegedly favored white applicants and denied applicants with even modest criminal records. HUD spent years building the case; it crumbled in 48 hours. (HUD officials shared details on these and other cases on the condition that ProPublica not name the parties or locations, as the deliberations are private.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.4">Without the support of agency leadership, HUD is in a weaker negotiating position, dimming the prospects of major settlements or reforms. In another case involving a public housing authority, this one on the East Coast, HUD is considering settling for no monetary penalty — although it would not have accepted less than $1 million under the prior administration, officials said. HUD found the housing authority excluded disabled applicants and that some of its buildings had tenants who were disproportionately white (which the authority has denied).</p>


<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.5">When settlement negotiations collapse, HUD regularly issues “charges of discrimination,” akin to filing a lawsuit. Four months into Joe Biden’s presidency, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250110094756/https:/www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/2021Charges.pdf">the agency had charged</a> at least eight cases and announced major steps in another four. In the second Trump presidency, HUD has not filed a single charge of housing discrimination, officials said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.6">It’s not for a lack of credible complaints, HUD officials say. There are dozens stuck in limbo at the agency’s Office of General Counsel, HUD officials estimated, including several where officials had conducted lengthy investigations and determined a civil rights law had been violated. One such complaint involves a New York woman who said she was sexually harassed for years by a maintenance worker in her building. The worker allegedly grabbed her breasts and told her that to receive repairs she would have to call him after hours — allegations that HUD officials found to be credible. But Trump appointees have not allowed them to file a charge, officials said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.7">Lovett, the HUD spokesperson, said that “the Department is preparing multiple charges that will be issued within the next week against individuals who we believe violated the Fair Housing Act.” She did not respond to a request for details about those charges.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.8">Many of the cases halted by HUD involve claims of housing discrimination because of someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Those appear to have been undermined by Trump’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">defending women</a>” executive order, issued on his first day in office, which eliminated executive branch recognition of transgender people. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/">Another executive order</a> declaring English the country’s official language has paralyzed cases involving the requirement that housing providers who receive federal funds try to reach people with limited English proficiency. Other cases now in peril involve environmental justice, like disputes over the construction of pollution-emitting factories in poor, predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. Race-based discrimination cases could be next on the chopping block, given the administration’s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, some HUD officials fear.</p>


<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.9">Previously there were many channels through which the public could file housing discrimination complaints to HUD. In March, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/06/fair-housing-enforcement-hud-cuts/">the agency shut down</a> all but one of them (with limited exceptions), citing staffing reductions. Now complaint hotlines and inboxes go unmonitored, with answering machines informing callers: “The number you reached is no longer in use.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.10">Investigations have been thwarted. Staffers can no longer travel to look for witnesses, as staff credit cards now have $1 spending limits. Agency attorneys must seek approval from a Trump appointee for basic tasks, such as issuing subpoenas, taking depositions, assisting with settlement discussions and even merely speaking to other attorneys in and outside government. As that approval seems to rarely come, investigations languish, HUD officials said. Even routine settlements now require approval from a political appointee, exacerbating the case backlog and delaying relief for victims, officials said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.11">The dysfunction has at times taken more mundane forms. For around two weeks in March, the Fair Housing Office’s work slowed to a crawl after DOGE canceled, without notice, a contract that had enabled staffers to quickly send certified mail to people involved in cases, according to officials and federal contracting data. It was a crucial resource — the office mails tens of thousands of documents each year, and regulations require some correspondence to be certified. Without the contract, staff had to spend their days stuffing envelopes themselves. The contract was worth only around $220,000. In recent years, HUD’s annual discretionary budget has topped $70 billion.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.12">Compliance reviews and discretionary investigations have also been affected. Typically that involves examining the policies and practices of developers, public housing authorities and other recipients of HUD funding to ensure that they abide by civil rights laws. Officials said such efforts have all but ceased, including an investigation into a housing authority that appeared to have a disproportionately low number of Latino tenants and applicants compared to the surrounding area. Larger, systemic investigations are similarly on ice.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.13">The apparent retreat in fair housing enforcement extends beyond HUD. At the Department of Justice, which prosecutes many fair housing cases, staffers received a draft of the housing section’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">new mission statement</a>, which omitted any mention of the Fair Housing Act. (The DOJ declined to comment.) At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump appointee Russ Vought has <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-seeks-to-vacate-abusive-unjust-case-against-townstone/">sought to vacate</a> a settlement with a company called Townstone Financial, which CFPB alleged had effectively discouraged African Americans from applying for mortgages. The agency is now proposing to return the settlement funds to the company. “CFPB abused its power, used radical ‘equity’ arguments to tag Townstone as racist with zero evidence, and spent years persecuting and extorting them,” <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-seeks-to-vacate-abusive-unjust-case-against-townstone/">Vought has said</a> to explain the decision. (CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. Townstone’s CEO said that he welcomed the move to vacate the settlement and that the prior allegations were meritless.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.14">The federal government’s fair housing efforts are supported by a broad ecosystem of local nonprofits. They, too, have been destabilized. In February, HUD and DOGE canceled 78 grants to local fair housing organizations, saying each one “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” The funding represented a minuscule fraction of HUD’s budget but was essential to grant recipients. That includes groups like Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Greater Cincinnati, which was forced to pause investigations into racist mortgage lending practices and apartment buildings that may flout accessibility laws, according to Executive Director Elisabeth Risch. Four of the organizations filed a class-action lawsuit, arguing HUD and DOGE had no authority to withhold funding approved by Congress. The litigation is ongoing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.15">Many states do not have their own substantial fair housing laws, leaving little recourse for housing discrimination victims in large swaths of the country if HUD’s retreat continues. “In the state of Missouri, HUD was it for housing protections,” said Kalila Jackson, an attorney in St. Louis. “It’s a terrifying situation.”</p>


<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.16">Fighting housing discrimination was once seen as so imperative that President Lyndon Johnson described the Fair Housing Act as a crowning achievement of the civil rights movement. “With this bill, the voice of justice speaks again,” he said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN7tMJvlDNU&amp;t=44s">when signing the legislation</a>. “It proclaims that fair housing for all — all human beings who live in this country — is now a part of the American way of life. “</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.17">But advocates and HUD officials say that ambition never became a reality. “The fair housing laws were never fully implemented,” said Erin Kemple, a vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. “If you look at segregation throughout the country, it is still very high in most places.” And the Fair Housing Office has been chronically understaffed and underfunded by Republican and Democratic administrations alike. The office has long struggled to clear its docket. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.18">In recent years, segregation has been on the rise by some measures. One study found that most major metropolitan areas were <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/roots-structural-racism">more segregated in 2019</a> than they had been in 1990. Another found that the Black homeownership rate is <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103501/the-future-of-headship-and-homeownership.pdf">lower now than</a> it was at the passage of the Fair Housing Act. And <a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-Fair-Housing-Trends-Report-FINAL_07.2024.pdf">more housing discrimination complaints</a> were filed in 2023 than in any other year since the National Fair Housing Alliance began tracking the figures three decades ago.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.19">Some advocates fear that a four-year federal retreat from the issue could send the country sliding back toward the pre-civil rights era, when landlords and mortgage lenders could freely reject applicants because of their race, and when federal agencies, local governments and real estate brokers could maintain policies that perpetuated extreme levels of segregation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.20">HUD officials interviewed by ProPublica echoed those concerns, foreseeing a growing national underclass of poor renters suffering discrimination with little hope of redress. They can always file lawsuits, but, for those at the bottom of the housing market, costly litigation is hardly an option. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.21">Even if today’s policies are undone by future administrations, there will be at least four years in which it may become easier for local zoning boards to block affordable housing, for mortgage lenders to retreat from nonwhite neighborhoods, and for developers to flout accessibility requirements in new buildings, HUD officials fear. The consequences of those changes could stretch far into the future. “Housing cycles are long,” one HUD official said. “This decimation will set us back for another several decades.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.22">April is Fair Housing Month, when HUD usually announces high-profile cases and holds events celebrating the Fair Housing Act. This April came and went without fanfare. HUD Secretary Scott Turner did release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymBjDdnHQCc">a two-minute video</a>, in which he vowed to “uphold the Fair Housing Act so every American has the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership.” He added: “A more fair and free housing market is truly part of President Trump’s golden age of America.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.23">Beyond that, Turner has had little to say about housing discrimination or segregation, beyond <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/26/trump-scraps-fair-housing-initiative-00206274">weakening a measure</a> known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. HUD even eliminated the Fair Housing Office’s old website. The URL now redirects to <a href="https://www.hud.gov/">HUD’s homepage</a>, which features a photo of a suburban cul-de-sac with a heavenly sunset behind it and a quote from Turner, a former NFL player and Baptist pastor.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In early February, Sharon Cromer, U.S. ambassador to Gambia, went to visit one of the country’s Cabinet ministers at his agency’s headquarters, above a partially abandoned strip mall off a dirt road. It had been two weeks since President Donald Trump took office, and Cromer had pressing business to discuss. She needed the minister to fall in line to help Elon Musk.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet company, had spent months trying to secure regulatory approval to sell internet access in the impoverished West African country. As head of Gambia’s communications ministry, Lamin Jabbi oversees the government’s review of Starlink’s license application. Jabbi had been slow to sign off and the company had grown impatient. Now the top U.S. government official in Gambia was in Jabbi’s office to intervene.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency loomed over the conversation. The administration had already begun freezing foreign aid projects, and early in the meeting, Cromer, a Biden appointee, said something that rattled Gambian officials in the room. She listed the ways that the U.S. was supporting the country, according to two people present and contemporaneous notes, noting that key initiatives — like one that funds a $25 million project to improve the electrical system — were currently under review. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">Jabbi’s top deputy, Hassan Jallow, told ProPublica he saw Cromer’s message as a veiled threat: If Starlink doesn’t get its license, the U.S. could cut off the desperately needed funds. “The implication was that they were connected,” Jallow said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">In recent months, senior State Department officials in both Washington and Gambia have coordinated with Starlink executives to coax, lobby and browbeat at least seven Gambian government ministers to help Musk, records and interviews show. One of those Cabinet officials told ProPublica his government is under “maximum pressure” to yield.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">In mid-March, Cromer escalated the campaign by writing to Gambia’s president with an “important request.” That day, a contentious D.C. meeting between Musk employees and Jabbi had ended in an impasse. She urged the president to circumvent Jabbi and “facilitate the necessary approvals for Starlink to commence operations,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by ProPublica. Jabbi told confidantes he felt the ambassador was trying to get him fired.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The saga in Gambia is the starkest known example of the Trump administration wielding the U.S. government’s foreign policy apparatus to advance the business interests of Musk, a top Trump adviser and the world’s richest man.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">Since Trump’s inauguration, the State Department has intervened on behalf of Starlink in Gambia and at least four other developing nations, previously unreported records and interviews show.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">As the Trump administration has gutted foreign aid, U.S. diplomats have pressed governments to fast-track licenses for Starlink and arranged conversations between company employees and foreign leaders. In cables, U.S. officials have said that for their foreign counterparts, helping Starlink is a chance to prove their commitment to good relations with the U.S.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.3">In one country last month, the U.S. embassy bragged that Starlink’s license was approved despite concerns it wasn’t abiding by rules that its competitors had to follow.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.4">“If this was done by another country, we absolutely would call this corruption,” said Kristofer Harrison, who served as a high-level State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. “Because it is corruption.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.5">Helping U.S. businesses has long been part of the State Department’s mission, but former ambassadors said they sought to do this by making the positive case for the benefits of U.S. investment. When seeking deals for U.S. companies, they said they took care to avoid the appearance of conflicts or leaving the impression that punitive measures were on the table.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.6">Ten current and former State Department officials said the recent drive was an alarming departure from standard diplomatic practice — because of both the tactics used and the person who would benefit most from them. “I honestly didn’t think we were capable of doing this,” one official told ProPublica. “That is bad on every level.” Kenneth Fairfax, a retired career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan, said the global push for Musk “could lead to the impression that the U.S. is engaging in a form of crony capitalism.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.7">The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/07/elon-musk-starlink-trump-tariffs/">Washington Post previously reported</a> that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has instructed U.S. diplomats to help Starlink so it can beat its Chinese and Russian competitors. Multiple countries, including India, have sped up license approvals for Starlink to try to build goodwill in tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, the Post reported.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.8">ProPublica’s reporting provides a detailed picture of what that push has looked like in practice. After Gambia’s ambassador to the U.S. declined an interview about Starlink — a topic seen as highly sensitive given Musk’s position — ProPublica reporters traveled to the capital, Banjul, to piece together the events. This account is based on internal State Department documents and interviews with dozens of current and former officials from both countries, most of whom requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.9">In response to detailed questions, the State Department issued a statement celebrating Starlink. “Starlink is an America-made product that has been a game changer in helping remote areas around the world gain internet connectivity,” a spokesperson wrote. “Any patriotic American should want to see an American company’s success on the global stage, especially over compromised Chinese competitors.” Cromer and Starlink did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the office of the president of Gambia. Jabbi made Jallow available to discuss the situation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.10">During the Biden administration, State Department officials worked with Starlink to help the company navigate bureaucracies abroad. But the agency’s approach appears to have become significantly more aggressive and expansive since Trump’s return to power, according to internal records and current and former government officials.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.11">Foreign leaders are acutely aware of Musk’s unprecedented position in the government, which he has used to help rewrite U.S. foreign policy. After Musk spent at least $288 million on the 2024 election, Trump gave the billionaire a powerful post in the White House. In mere months, Musk’s team has directed the firing of thousands of federal workers, canceled billions of dollars in programs and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which supported humanitarian projects around the world. African nations have been particularly hard-hit by the cuts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.12">At the same time, Musk continues to run Starlink and the rest of his corporate empire. In past administrations, government ethics lawyers carefully vetted potential conflicts of interest. Though Trump once said that “we won’t let him get near” conflicts, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html">White House </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html">has also suggested</a> Musk is responsible for policing himself. The billionaire has waved away criticisms of the arrangement, saying “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304123/elon-musks-role-in-government-raises-conflict-of-interest-issues">I’ll recuse myself</a>” if conflicts arise. “My companies are suffering because I’m in the government,” Musk said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.13">In a statement, the White House said Musk has nothing to do with deals involving Starlink and that every administration official follows ethical guidelines. “For the umpteenth time, President Trump will not tolerate any conflicts of interest,” spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.14">Executives at Starlink have seized the moment to expand. An April State Department cable to D.C. obtained by ProPublica quoted a Starlink employee describing the company’s approach to securing a license in Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in Africa that hosts an American military base: “We’re pushing from the top and the bottom to ram this through.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Musk entered the White House at a pivotal moment for Starlink. When the service launched in 2020, it had a novel approach to internet access. Rather than relying on underground cables or cell towers like traditional telecom companies, Starlink uses low-orbiting satellites that let it provide fast internet in places its competitors had struggled to reach. Expectations for the startup were sky high. Bullish Morgan Stanley analysts predicted that by 2040, Starlink would have up to 364 million subscribers worldwide — more than the current population of the U.S. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.1">Starlink quickly became a central pillar of Musk’s fortune. His stake in Starlink’s parent company, SpaceX, is estimated to be worth about $150 billion of his roughly $400 billion net worth. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.2">Although the company says its user base has grown to over 5 million people, it remains a bit player compared to the largest internet providers. And the satellite internet market is set to become more competitive as well-funded companies launch services modeled on Starlink. Jeff Bezos’ Project Kuiper, a unit of Amazon, has said it expects to start serving customers later this year. Satellite upstarts headquartered in Europe and China aren’t far behind either.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.3">“They want to get as far and as fast as they can before Amazon Kuiper gets online,” said Chris Quilty, a veteran space industry analyst. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.4">In internal cables, State Department officials have said they are eager to help Musk get ahead of foreign satellite companies. Securing licenses in the next 18 months is critical for Starlink due to the growing competition, one cable said last month. Senior diplomats have written that they hope to give Musk’s company a “first-mover advantage.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.5">Africa represents a lucrative prize. Much of the continent lacks reliable internet. Success in Africa could mean dominating a market with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/28/world/africa/africa-youth-population.html">fastest-growing population</a> on earth.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">As of last November, Starlink had reportedly launched in 15 of Africa’s 54 countries, but it was beginning to spark a backlash. Last year, Cameroon and Namibia cracked down on Musk’s company for allegedly operating in their countries illegally. In South Africa — where Starlink has so far failed to get a license — Musk exacerbated tensions by publicly accusing the government of anti-white racism. Since Trump won the election, at least five African countries have granted licenses to Starlink: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho and Chad.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.1">Now Musk’s campaign of cuts has given him leverage inside the State Department. A Trump administration memo that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/state-dept-expands-plans-for-closing-embassies-and-consulates.html">leaked to the press</a> last month proposed closing six embassies in Africa. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.2">The Gambian embassy was on the list of proposed cuts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.3">An 8-year-old democracy, Gambia’s 2.7 million residents live on a sliver of land once used as a hub in the transatlantic slave trade. For two decades until 2017, the nation was ruled by a despot who had his opponents assassinated and plundered public funds to buy himself luxuries like a Rolls-Royce collection and a private zoo. When the dictator was ousted, the economy was in tatters. Today Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with about half the country living on less than $4 a day.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.4">In this fragile environment, the telecom industry that Jabbi oversees is vitally important to Gambian authorities. According to the government, the sector provides at least 20% of the country’s tax revenue. Ads for the country’s multiple internet providers are ubiquitous, painted onto dozens of public works — parks, police booths, schools. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.5">It’s unclear why Starlink’s efforts in Gambia, a tiny market, have been so intense.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Cromer’s efforts on behalf of the company started under the Biden administration, as she documented last December in a cable sent back to Washington. Last spring, Starlink began the process of securing necessary approvals from a local utilities regulator and the Gambian communications agency. The utilities regulator wanted Starlink to pay an $85,000 license fee, which the company felt was too expensive. Cromer spoke to local officials, who then “pressured” the regulator to remove “this unnecessary barrier to entry,” the ambassador wrote.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.1">Gambian supporters of Starlink felt that its product would be a boon for consumers and for economic growth in the country, where internet service remains unreliable and slow. “The ripple effects could be extraordinary,” Cromer said in the December cable, contending it could enable telehealth and improve education. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.2">Opponents argued that local internet providers were one of Gambia’s few stable sources of jobs and infrastructure investments. If Starlink killed off its competition and then jacked up its prices — in Nigeria, the company announced last year it would suddenly double its fees — authorities could have little leverage to manage the fallout. When Musk refused to turn on Starlink in part of Ukraine during the war there, it heightened concerns about handing control of internet access to the mercurial billionaire, industry analysts said. One Musk tweet about foreign regulators’ ability to police his company caught the attention of Gambian critics: “They can shake their fist at the sky,” Musk said in 2021.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.3">The ultimate authority for granting Starlink a license lies with Jabbi, an attorney who spent years in the local telecom sector. Gambian telecom companies that don’t want competition from Musk see Jabbi as an ally. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.4">Jallow, Jabbi’s top deputy, told ProPublica that the ministry is not opposed to Starlink operating in Gambia. But he said Jabbi is doing due diligence to ensure laws and regulations are being followed before opening up the country to a consequential change. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.5">After Trump’s inauguration, Jabbi’s position pitted him against not only Starlink but also the U.S. government. In the weeks after the February meeting where Cromer reminded Jabbi about the tenuous state of American funding to his country, the ambassador told other diplomats that getting Starlink approved was a high priority, according to a Western official familiar with her comments.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.6">The stance surprised some of Cromer’s peers. Cromer had spent her career at USAID before President Joe Biden appointed her as ambassador. Her tenure in Gambia often focused on human rights and democracy building.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.7">In March, when Jabbi and Jallow traveled to D.C. to attend a World Bank summit, the State Department helped arrange a series of meetings for them. The first, on March 19, was with Starlink representatives including Ben MacWilliams, a former U.S. diplomat who leads the company’s expansion efforts in Africa. The second was with U.S. government officials at the State Department’s headquarters.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.8">The meeting with the company quickly became contentious. Huddled in a conference room at the World Bank, MacWilliams accused Jabbi of standing in the way of his nation’s progress and harming ordinary Gambians, according to Jallow, who was in the meeting, and four others briefed on the event. “We want our license now,” Jallow recalled MacWilliams saying. “Why are you delaying it?” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.9">The conversation ended in a stalemate. In the hours that followed, Starlink and the U.S. government’s campaign intensified in a way that underscored the degree of coordination between the two parties. The company told Jabbi it would cancel his scheduled D.C. meeting with State Department officials because “there was no more need,” Jallow said. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.10">The State Department meeting never happened. Instead, 4,000 miles away in Gambia’s capital, Cromer would try an even more aggressive approach.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.11">That same day, Cromer had already met with Gambia’s equivalent of a commerce secretary to lobby him to help pave the way for Starlink. Then she was informed about the disappointing meeting Starlink had had in D.C., according to State Department records. By day’s end, Cromer had sent a letter to the nation’s president.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.12">“I am writing to seek your support to allow Starlink to operate in The Gambia,” the letter opened. Over three pages, the ambassador described her concerns about Jabbi’s agency and listed the ways that Gambians could benefit from Starlink. She also said the company had satisfied conditions set by Jabbi’s predecessor.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.13">“I respectfully urge you to facilitate the necessary approvals for Starlink to commence operations in The Gambia,” Cromer concluded. “I look forward to your favorable response.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.14">In the weeks since, Jabbi has refused to budge. The U.S. government’s efforts have continued. In late April, Gambia’s attorney general met in D.C. with senior State Department officials, according to a person familiar with the matter, where they again discussed the Starlink issue. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.15">Diplomats were troubled by how the pressure campaign could hurt America’s image overseas. “This is not Iran or a rogue African state run by a dictator — this is a democracy, a natural ally,” said another senior Western diplomat in the region, noting that Gambia is “a prime partner of the West” in United Nations votes. “You beat up the smallest and the best boy in the class.”</p>


<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.16">Gambia is not the only country being leaned on. Since Trump took office, embassies around the world have sent a flurry of cables to D.C. documenting their meetings with Starlink executives and their efforts to cajole developing countries into helping Musk’s business. The cables all describe a problem similar to what happened in Gambia: The company has struggled to win a license from local regulators. In some countries, ambassadors reported, their work appears to be yielding results. (The embassies and their host countries did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.17">The U.S. embassy in Cameroon wrote that the country could prove its commitment to Trump’s agenda by letting Starlink expand its presence there. In the same missive, embassy officials discussed the impact of U.S. aid cuts and deportations and cited a humanitarian official who was reckoning with America’s shifting foreign policy: “They may not be happy with what they see, but they are trying to adapt as best they can.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.18">In Lesotho, where embassy officials had spent weeks trying to help Starlink get a license, the company finalized a deal after Trump imposed 50% tariffs on the tiny landlocked country. Lesotho officials told embassy staff they hoped the license would help in their urgent push to reduce the levies, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-tariffs-lesotho-state-department-starlink-deportees/">according to Mother Jones</a>. A major multinational company complained that Starlink was getting preferential treatment, embassy documents obtained by ProPublica show, since Musk’s firm had been exempted from requirements its competitors still had to follow. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.19">In cables sent from the U.S. embassy in Djibouti this spring, State Department officials recounted their meetings with the company and pledged to continue working with “Starlink in identifying government officials and facilitating discussions.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.20">In Bangladesh, U.S. diplomats pressed Starlink’s case “early and often” with local officials, partnered with Starlink to “build an educational strategy” for their counterparts and helped arrange a conversation between Musk and the nation’s head of state, according to a recent cable. The embassy’s work started under Biden but bore fruit only after Trump took office.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.21">Their efforts resulted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/30/elon-musk-starlink-bangladesh-tariffs/">in Bangladesh</a> approving Starlink’s request to do business in the country, the top U.S. diplomat there said last month, a sign-off that Musk’s company had sought for years.</p>

Title: Connecticut Towing Companies Use Belongings Left in Cars as Leverage to Collect Fees, Drivers Say

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Gary Hudson excitedly planned a fishing trip with his 4-year-old son and purchased a kids fishing pole in late 2019. He tossed it in the trunk of his Ford Taurus and parked on the street outside his Hartford, Connecticut, home.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">Within hours, his car was hauled away by a tow truck. Hudson couldn’t afford to pay the more than $300 in towing and storage fees and asked if he could at least get into the car to collect his belongings — the fishing pole and the safety vest and handcuffs he needed to work nights as a security guard. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">He said he offered to pay $20 but that Whitey’s, a Hartford towing company, told him he had to pay the full amount. “They would not budge, period,” Hudson said. “So I can’t get my work equipment, and you expect me to make money to pay you?” When Hudson couldn’t afford to retrieve the car, he said, Whitey’s sold it, and he lost his belongings. Whitey’s has since closed, and its owner has died.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have heard repeatedly from people with similar stories. Inside their vehicles, they had work equipment, child car seats or personal mementos, and towing companies refused to give them back.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.4">Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles regulations say that vehicle owners can retrieve “personal property which is essential to the health or welfare of any person.” But that gives towing companies wide latitude in how they interpret the rule, and several people whose cars were towed said the companies used their belongings as leverage to get them to pay towing and storage fees.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Past reporting by CT Mirror and ProPublica showed <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/on-the-hook">how Connecticut’s laws have come to favor tow companies</a> at the expense of vehicle owners. Connecticut has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-tow-companies-car-sales">one of the shortest windows</a> in the country between when a car is towed and when tow companies can consider it abandoned and start the process of selling it — companies have to wait just 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500. People with low incomes have been particularly impacted by these laws, the news organizations found.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">Some nearby states, like Rhode Island, have no law on the books about getting possessions from towed cars. But in those that do, the list of items owners must be allowed to retrieve is often broader than Connecticut’s. Maine allows people to retrieve clothing, car seats, medications and mail. In New York, people can retrieve anything from the vehicle. A bill in the Massachusetts legislature would let its drivers do the same.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">In an interview last year, Michelle Givens, the Connecticut DMV’s assistant legal director, said she couldn’t say whether work equipment qualified as essential to health or welfare.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.3">“It’s broad,” Givens said. “I can’t answer that and sit here and say, ‘Yes, that will qualify.’”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        <p>So I can’t get my work equipment, and you expect me to make money to pay you?</p>

    
        
        —Gary Hudson, a security guard who was not allowed to get his belongings out of his towed car

    
    

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera said he thought car owners should file a complaint with the agency if they weren’t able to get their belongings out. The complaint process can take weeks, however, which is often longer than the period before a towing company is allowed to sell a car.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">Timothy Vibert, president of the industry association Towing &amp; Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said people can generally retrieve medicine or tools, but he said that part of the law shouldn’t apply if people wait months to get them. He added that when people don’t pay the towing fees, it makes towers reluctant to return their belongings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">“If somebody owed you $800 and they called up and said they wanted to get something out of their car,” he asked, “it’s OK for them to waltz down here and take their things and then leave you with an $800 bill?”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.3">Other towers say they are more lenient. Sal Sena, owner of Sena Brothers and Cross Country Automotive in Hartford, said if someone has keys to the vehicle or can prove it’s theirs, he lets them get stuff out of it regardless if they pay the fees.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.4">“I don’t care if you take stuff out, but I just want to make sure you’re not putting my ass in a situation where I’m gonna get in trouble,” Sena said. “You got the key? Then take what you want out of the car because then I can justify it.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.5">Connecticut lawmakers are looking to change the state’s towing laws. House Bill 7162, which was voted out of committee in March, would overhaul the law and allow owners to retrieve “any personal property” from a towed motor vehicle. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.6">The bill “makes a strong effort to identify and correct abusive practices in the towing industry that have had a serious and detrimental effect on motor vehicle owners,” legal aid attorney Rafie Podolsky said in public testimony.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.7">Tow company employees and owners have objected to the bill, saying it would make it harder for them to tow vehicles that are parked illegally or unsafely and that towers didn’t have enough involvement in crafting the legislation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.8">Transportation Committee co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, said during a March meeting that the importance of the issue hit home for her because of “the number of folks” who have told her they got towed and weren’t allowed to retrieve belongings from their vehicles.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.9">“The people should certainly be made aware of their rights with respect to towed vehicles,” she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.10">Hudson, who had planned the fishing trip, had to save up to replace his holster, mace and safety equipment for the security job, which he estimated cost him about $1,000. He canceled the fishing trip and said he failed his son “by breaking a promise.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.11">“It really, really hurt,” Hudson said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.12">Hudson is one of several people who told the news organizations they lost things they needed for work — tools, chef’s knives, even the draft of a movie script. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.13">Paul Boudreau, a carpenter and mechanic in Hamden, said he lost his entire carpentry tool set worth more than $1,500 when his Chevrolet Blazer was towed from his apartment complex in April 2021. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.14">The vehicle wasn’t registered because it couldn’t pass an emissions test, and his mechanic was waiting on a part that was hard to get during the supply chain crisis following the COVID-19 lockdown. The apartment complex’s management gave him more time to get it registered, he said, so he was surprised when he looked out his window and saw a tow truck hooking up his vehicle. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.15">He said MyHoopty.com, a towing company in Watertown, told him it would cost more than $300 to get it back. With his wife recovering from cancer, his carpentry work scarce because of the pandemic and “not a penny in cash,” Boudreau realized he couldn’t afford to retrieve his car. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.16">Still, he asked multiple times to retrieve his tools and was denied, he told the DMV in a complaint, which included an itemized list of tools. But MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said in an interview, “At no point did anyone contact us or attempt to come down and retrieve any personal belongings that may have been in the vehicle.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.17">The Connecticut DMV found that MyHoopty committed no violations related to the tow but did not address the items Boudreau said were in the vehicle.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.18">“Anybody we talked to was like, ‘There’s nothing we can do,’” Boudreau said in an interview.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.19">After 18 days, MyHoopty submitted a form to sell the Blazer.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.20">The tows at his apartment complex led Boudreau to become a tenant union organizer. He said state legislators always tell him that when it comes to landlords, their “property is sacred.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">“Why isn’t our property sacred? Why isn’t our car sacred?” Boudreau asked about tenants. “Wealthy people’s property is always sacred, but poor people’s property doesn’t mean a thing.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.1">Other drivers lost belongings that held sentimental value — photographs, a sewing project, a prayer card from their father’s funeral.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.2">When Brandon Joyner’s Nissan Maxima was towed from the front of his Bridgeport home in 2017, he lost photos of his mother and aunt that had never been digitized, which he’d traveled with since he got his license as a teenager. He also had shoes, clothing and a car seat for his nieces and nephews in the vehicle, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.3">The car was towed because Joyner owed motor vehicle taxes on it. After a couple of weeks of saving, he paid the taxes. But when he asked for his car, he said he was told it had been sold.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.4">“Everything was just gone,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.5">It took him months to afford a new vehicle, in part because he was still paying down the old loan from the bank. When he told them he no longer had the vehicle and didn’t want to pay on it, it damaged his credit score, making it harder to get a loan for a new car, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.6">“It was hurtful, because there’s nothing you can really do,” Joyner said. “No matter how many people you talk to, you lose things, and it’s nobody’s fault, nobody cares.”</p>

Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">购买特朗普币，就能与获得与总统“面对面”的机会，持有量前25名的名单已经公布，排名第一的是孙宇晨！</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普币官方网站近日宣布，5月22日特朗普币晚宴入场的名单已经出炉，加密情报公司Inca Digital称，为了赢得与特朗普共进晚餐的机会，特朗普币买家总共花费了约1.48亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普币官网显示了前220名特朗普币持有者的排行榜。排行榜上名列第一的是一个名为“SUN”的钱包，持有价值约1790万美元的特朗普币。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据<span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3745798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及</a></span>，特朗普币官网4月宣布，5月22日在特朗普私人高尔夫俱乐部邀请持币量前220名持有者共进晚餐，持有量前25名更是能够获得超级VIP待遇，包括参观白宫的机会。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这一消息引发了特朗普币的疯狂抢购。自晚宴宣布以来，特朗普币价格上涨了近30%，不过仍远低于1月的峰值。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f14e4130-fd18-4079-afb5-4da5966ffbc5.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="645" data-wscnw="811"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">砸钱买特朗普币，孙宇晨买最多</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">在过去三周，“特朗普币”的价格波动剧烈，众多支持者和加密爱好者争相购买，以争取参与晚宴的资格。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据特朗普币官网排行榜，名列第一的是一个名为“SUN”的钱包。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据Lookonchain的数据，该钱包由波场币创始人、加密货币亿万富翁孙宇晨（Justin SUN）所有。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据两家加密货币取证公司称，该账户属于一家名为HTX的海外交易所，亿万富翁、加密货币平台波场的创始人孙宇晨担任该交易所的全球顾问。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">排名第二的是新加坡加密货币初创公司MemeCore，持有价值约1740万美元的特朗普币，是第二大持有者。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">该公司正在开发一个面向迷因币创建者的平台，首席业务发展官Cherry Hsu表示，正寻求与美国迷因币社区建立桥梁。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">另据报道，澳大利亚企业家Kain Warwick也在排行榜上，他表示希望能在晚宴上和特朗普或他的二儿子Eric Trump聊几分钟。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">一位来自纽约的加密货币爱好者Vincent Deriu通过购买约11.6万美元的特朗普币赢得了参加晚宴的资格。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">他表示，即将举行的晚宴是一种比传统的大额资金筹款活动更民主的方式，这可能是唯一允许接触总统的机会。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">政府监督组织谴责晚宴</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">据报道，大量外国投资者占据VIP席位，伦理观察组织警告，这可能违反联邦规定和宪法的授权条款。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据区块链分析公司Inca Digital的数据，在有资格参加接待会的25个钱包中，至少有17个收到了来自美国人无法使用的非美国加密货币交易所的资金。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这表明VIP接待会的许多与会者可能是外国人，加剧了外界对特朗普家族商业利益与外国势力之间潜在利益冲突的担忧。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#34;这是一场伦理噩梦，&#34;奥巴马政府前白宫特别伦理和政府改革顾问Norm Eisen表示。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据报道，在特朗普第二个任期的四个月里，他和他的家人频频利用总统职位为家族产业谋利益。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">除了迷因币外，他们在加密货币领域的涉足还包括一家比特币挖矿公司和World Liberty Financial，这是由特朗普的儿子们推广的风险投资项目。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746514" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及</a></span>，特朗普次子Eric Trump早前宣布，由阿布扎比政府支持的一家风险投资公司将使用World Liberty提供的数字货币进行20亿美元的投资。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">批评人士表示，鉴于总统已经减少了加密货币监管，这些都构成了利益冲突。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">康涅狄格州民主党参议员Richard Blumenthal称，这将是美国历史上最令人发指的利用职权谋取私利的行为之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">白宫方面表示，这场由特朗普在其社交平台上推广的拍卖活动不会影响总统的政策决策。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">白宫新闻秘书罗琳·莱维特此前对记者表示，特朗普在其加密货币相关活动中“完全遵守所有利益冲突法律”。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  Bill Ackman一季度：增持Uber，赶在关税前清仓了耐克 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">根据周四提交给美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的监管文件，亿万富翁、对冲基金大佬Bill Ackman的潘兴广场资本管理公司（Pershing Square）一季度大幅增持Uber，使其成为投资组合第一大持仓股，还增持了Brookfield和谷歌A类股，清仓耐克，减持希尔顿和谷歌C类股。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，谷歌A类股和C类股不同地方在于，A类股具有投票权；C类股没有投票权。此外，从整个投资组合来看，截至2025年第一季度末，Ackman的投资组合包括11只股票，主要集中在消费循环、科技、金融服务、通信服务、房地产和工业六个行业。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/00c5892f-d8be-4af5-8d2e-c0bd59a3764d.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="852" data-wscnw="1173"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">投资组合重大调整：Uber登顶，耐克出局</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据最新提交的13F文件显示，Bill Ackman的Pershing Square在2025年第一季度进行了重大投资组合调整。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">文件显示，Ackman一季度增持超过3030万股Uber Technologies的持仓，总价值达22.1亿美元，这使得Uber一跃成为其投资组合的最大持仓，占比高达18.5%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/07285d6e-3327-43e2-8ff8-45e8d8dc8312.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="512" data-wscnw="1173"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">与此同时，Ackman完全清仓了此前持有的1876.9万股耐克股票，值得注意的是，这是赶在特朗普所谓“对等关税”前采取行动。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">重要增持：Brookfield和谷歌A类股成为焦点</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">除了Uber之外，Ackman还增加了全球最大的另类资管巨头之一的Brookfield和谷歌A的持仓。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">将Brookfield的持股增加了17.52%，新增611.1万股，总持股量达到4100.5万股，总价值约21.5亿美元，成为投资组合第二大持仓，占比达到18.01%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">谷歌A持股新增45.1万股，增幅为11.33%，总持股达到443.8万股，价值约6.86亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，Ackman还增加了对赫兹租车（Hertz Global Holdings）的持股，增幅达18%。这一举动是4月通过更新的SEC文件披露的，原本因保密请求而未在第四季度持股文件中显示的1270万股购买现已公开。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">重大减持：希尔顿遭大幅削减，谷歌C类股不被看好</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">除了清仓耐克之外，在减持方面，Ackman对希尔顿环球控股(Hilton Worldwide Holdings)进行了大幅裁减，减少了243.98万股，降幅高达44.84%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，Ackman还减持了谷歌C类股票122.36万股，减持幅度16.21%。值得注意的是，年初至今，谷歌C类股票下跌13.05%</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">周四公布的最新13F报告显示，截至今年第一季度，索罗斯基金<strong>增持标普500ETF，同时加码电力公司股票</strong>。此外，<strong>清仓罗素2000ETF、阿里巴巴和台积电</strong>并<strong>大幅减持谷歌和京东的持股比例</strong>。数据显示，一季度末索罗斯基金持股主要集中在<strong>周期性消费、科技技术、金融服务和防御性消费等</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在经济增长放缓、利率高企的背景下，小型企业往往比大型企业面临更大的经营压力。索罗斯&#34;买大盘、抛小盘&#34;，同时配置公用事业和稳定收益资产的操作，或许表明其正在为更加动荡的市场环境做准备。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/4f38847d-9350-4748-a477-e133919b8974.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="425" data-wscnw="846"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，一季度索罗斯基金对科技板块进行了重大调整。<strong>一方面，索罗斯完全清仓了今年表现亮眼的超微电脑和台积电。另一方面，索罗斯新开仓了芯片巨头英伟达</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/c3429c0e-4c13-4151-b6f1-25b00ba5c100.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="43" data-wscnw="1118"/><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/c616d288-c290-4ef9-9c59-a498343d0ddf.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="44" data-wscnw="1030"/><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9fc6e689-b640-43c5-83f7-4e0f727e9ef3.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="42" data-wscnw="1113"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">以下为索罗斯基金一季度的前10大持仓：</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/99de6e59-2e0a-4df6-8c66-5187987586e7.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="466" data-wscnw="846"/></p>
<h2 id="75a22525">加码公用事业和金融板块</h2>
<p>索罗斯基金在一季度共新增97只股票，<strong>其中最引人注目的是公用事业和金融板块的大幅布局</strong>：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>最大新增持仓为美国电力公司(American Electric Power)，买入878,960股，价值9604.4万美元，占投资组合1.9%；</li>
<li>第二大新增持仓为Entergy Corp，买入1,095,279股，价值9363.5万美元，占投资组合1.85%；</li>
<li>第三大新增持仓是摩根大通，购入230,963股，占投资组合1.12%，总价值约5,666万美元；</li>
<li>此外，一季度还新开仓了卫星制造商AST SpaceMobile——SpaceX的竞争对手，以及比特币矿商Cipher Mining。</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>增持方面</strong>，索罗斯基金第一季度：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>大幅增加了亚马逊约30%的持仓；</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/c7fae803-7e6b-4358-bc3e-4dd5c967b170.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="161" data-wscnw="1140"/></p>
<ul>
<li>相较第四季度，联邦快递FedEx的持股比例增加了超270%，并通过股票和期权的组合大幅增加First Solar的持股近9倍；</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/74c99efb-b355-4704-b3f6-300b760de533.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="278" data-wscnw="1007"/></p>
<ul>
<li>同时，索罗斯还将联合健康集团(UNH)的持仓组合增加了一倍以上，尽管据报道，该公司目前正面临其保险欺诈的刑事调查。</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a1d66a31-f997-4603-a735-42f19da65078.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="88" data-wscnw="1031"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>分析师指出，此次调仓表明索罗斯正在增加对公用事业和稳定收益资产的配置，可能是在为更加动荡的市场环境做准备。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">重大清仓：部分科技股和中概股遭抛售</h2>
<p>在一季度中，索罗斯基金完全清仓了78只股票，减持45只股票。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/79ea4c63-4cae-4e8a-8c17-e52dec454f2a.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="473" data-wscnw="622"/></p>
<p>除了前面提到的小型股、超微电脑和台积电外，索罗斯基金还完全清仓了：<strong>保险公司Arthur J. Gallagher的所有300,000股、Airbnb、阿里巴巴和波音的所有持股</strong>。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/7752a52b-c520-446b-8f7d-66f122cd265e.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="415" data-wscnw="1016"/></p>
<p><strong>减持方面</strong>，索罗斯基金减持了38只股票。最显著的变化包括：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>谷歌母公司Alphabet的833,923股，减持幅度达62.64%，对投资组合影响为-3.24%。</li>
</ul>

Title:  当下最火的问题：美股反弹到头了吗？摩根大通市场部门：还没有，这真让人痛苦 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">在经历了令人印象深刻的反弹之后，投资者们不禁要问，这次市场反弹是否已经结束？</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通的市场部门负责人Andrew Tyler的回答是：尚未结束。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在最新发布的报告中，Tyler表示，<strong>当前牛市的核心要素仍然存在（宏观数据具有韧性，盈利向好，以及贸易形势缓和），但复苏的速度使得这次上涨成为“最不受欢迎”的上涨之一，增量买盘主要来自散户投资者和企业。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tyler还指出，虽然回调的风险正在上升，但再次回调的可能性不大。 集中度风险将加剧对回调风险的担忧，因为这可能与去年上半年的市场类似，主要集中于大型科技股上，<strong>预计标普500指数本季度应该会触及历史高点（6144点）。</strong></p>
<h2><strong>收益率上升推动投资者转向股市</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通分析了市场对10年期美债收益率突破4.5%的反应。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tyler认为，这并不完全是负面因素。他的同事John Schlegel发现，<strong>在后疫情时代，当10年期美债收益率创出新高时，股市需要1-2个月的时间来消化和调整。周期高点为5%，所以仍有一定上涨空间。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/8413eac1-0301-4c68-b17f-bb21fe712f19.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="273" data-wscnw="500"/></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通进一步指出<strong>，</strong>收益率的上升应会促使投资者转向高质量的股票，尤其是大型科技股，同时对必需消费品和公用事业板块构成压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">该行的利率策略师还将其2025年底的10年期国债收益率预测从4%上调至4.35%，将2年期美债收益率预测从3.1%上调至3.5%。这种收益率预测的增加源于更高的实际GDP增长预期和更低的通胀预期，导致降息周期推迟且幅度减小。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尽管市场大幅反弹，但机构持仓情况却显示出不同的图景——对冲基金仍在净卖出，杠杆率仍接近历史低点，市场情绪低迷。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通认为，<strong>由于市场仍存在大量怀疑情绪，如果这次反弹真的能持续，那么可能会出现意想不到的情况。</strong></p>
<h2><strong>市场情绪较为乐观，Mag 7正在回归“旧模式”</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通交易部门的其他成员也分享了他们的看法：</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TMT部门的Brian Heavey指出，活跃的多头投资者似乎配置不足，表现逊于标普500指数的上涨。尽管如此，并未看到大规模的“追高”——该行实际上在昨天净卖出科技股。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">随着更广泛的指数收复关键支撑位，CTA开始成为更好的买家，股票回购增加，任何短期下跌都可能较浅，因为主动型资金将被迫重新进入更高风险/更高贝塔值的股票。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">工业部门的Paige Hanson指出，市场反弹在周二表现出工业板块的韧性，之前由于工业板块和周期性股票的空头回补，这些股票在周一表现不佳；然而，周二，<strong>这些被看好的周期性股票出现补涨，表现优于大盘，且反弹更加健康，这表明主动增持而非被动回补。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">同时，根据摩根大通近日在波士顿举办的科技大会的反馈，尽管化工/运输/住房等股票的市场波动较大，但目前尚未听到市场情绪发生实质性变化，<strong>企业和投资者对宏观/市场持相当乐观的态度。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">消费部门的Briggs Barton表示，最新数据显示，截至5月6日，<strong>消费者支出数据表现积极。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">期货期权部门的Marissa Gitler指出，<strong>Mag 7正在回归“旧模式”，即当对宏观前景感到担忧时，可以买入“安全”的大型科技股。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">年初，资金从美国风险资产流出，主要集中在Mag7。现在，资金回流美国风险资产，似乎正在逆转这一趋势并缩小差距。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  巴菲特、索罗斯、盖茨，看看大佬们买了点啥 
Description:  <p>每季度的13F报告，都是投资者观察顶级资金动向的窗口。一季度，在关税风暴来临前，华尔街大佬们做了哪些调整？</p>
<p><strong>从巴菲特“持币不买“的策略，到索罗斯的&#34;抛小盘买大盘&#34;，再到桥水的黄金配置，都显示出顶级投资者正在增强组合的防御性，而嗅觉灵敏的Ackman更是赶在关税前清仓了耐克。</strong></p>
<p><strong>对科技股态度出现分化</strong>，巴菲特依然坚守苹果，索罗斯加仓英伟达、清仓超微电脑，桥水则减持了谷歌、英伟达、Meta等。</p>
<p><strong>对于中概股</strong>，曾豪言“买入一切中国资产”的对冲基金大佬David Tepper谨慎乐观，虽减持阿里，但仍维持其第一大持仓的地位。桥水则果断加码，一季度新进京东持仓，增持阿里巴巴、百度。</p>
<h2><strong>巴菲特：坚守苹果，清仓花旗，持币不买</strong></h2>
<p>&#34;股神&#34;依然保持着他标志性的稳健风格。</p>
<p>本季最大变化是彻底清仓了花旗集团，同时减持了部分金融股，这或许反映了巴菲特对传统金融业前景的谨慎态度。</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">据监管文件显示</a>，伯克希尔出售了全部1464万股花旗集团股票，减持了4866万股美国银行股票（减持比例超过7%），以及减持了30万股第一资本金融公司股票（约4%）。</p>
<p>不过，巴菲特的核心持仓依然稳如磐石：苹果继续占据首位，持有3亿股，约占投资组合的25%，市值高达666亿美元；美国运通紧随其后，可口可乐稳居第三，此外还有美银和雪佛龙。</p>
<p>值得一提的是，伯克希尔向SEC提出了保密请求，要求对一项或多项股票投资暂不披露。媒体分析认为，如果此次保密持仓仅为一只股票，其投资规模可能在10亿至20亿美元之间，很可能属于&#34;商业与工业类&#34;股票。</p>
<p>在市场波动加剧的环境下，巴菲特的&#34;不买，还是不买&#34;策略似乎在传递一个信号——当前充满不确定性的市场环境下，现金或许是更好的选择。</p>
<h2><strong>索罗斯：转向防守姿态</strong></h2>
<p>索罗斯基金在一季度作出了防御性调整，增持标普500指数，同时减持罗素2000小盘股指数。</p>
<p>根据最新提交的13F文件显示，索罗斯基金管理公司一季度完全清仓了iShares罗素2000ETF(IWM)的所有75.2万股持仓，此举对其投资组合产生了-3.41%的影响。</p>
<p>与此同时，大幅增持了SPDR标普500ETF(SPY)，新增19.6万股，使总持股量达到31.4万股，增幅高达165.93%，对当前投资组合的影响达2.17%，总价值约1.76亿美元。</p>
<p>在经济增长放缓、利率高企的背景下，小型企业往往比大型企业面临更大的经营压力。索罗斯&#34;买大盘、抛小盘&#34;操作或许表明，他认为未来市场波动中，大型企业的抗风险能力将更胜一筹。</p>
<h2><strong>桥水：买入3亿美元黄金，看多新兴市场，减持谷歌和英伟达</strong></h2>
<p>由Ray Dalio创立、目前管理约920亿美元资产的桥水基金，在一季度进行了大幅度的投资组合重构。最引人注目的是，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">桥水新建立了SPDR黄金ETF的大型头寸</a>，买入3亿美元黄金ETF（GLD），成为其美股第六大持仓。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/7461d868-6977-4361-954b-a1cdea016873.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="353" data-wscnw="1024"/></p>
<p>与此同时，桥水虽然将其最大的多头头寸SPDR标普500 ETF削减了一半以上，但小幅增持了iShares核心标普500 ETF和iShares核心MSCI新兴市场ETF。这表明桥水虽然降低了对美国市场的总体敞口，但仍看好市场整体走势，并更加关注新兴市场机会。</p>
<p>桥水还增持了阿里巴巴集团540多万股，使其总持股量达到约566万股，并将在线旅游代理Booking Holdings和云计算巨头Salesforce的持仓翻了一番以上。</p>
<p>反观其对&#34;华尔街七巨头&#34;中的谷歌和英伟达却分别减持了约15%和18%以上，显示出对科技巨头的谨慎态度。</p>
<h2><strong>Ackman</strong><strong>：清仓耐克，提前预判关税风险</strong></h2>
<p>Bill Ackman一季度的第一个大动作是重仓Uber。他旗下的潘兴广场资本在一季度增持了3030万股Uber，总市值22.1亿美元，使其一跃成为第一大持仓股（占比18.5%）。</p>
<p>更值得关注的是，他在美国宣布 “对等关税”之前，完全清仓了此前持有的1876.9万股耐克，预判到耐克这类高度全球化企业，在新一轮贸易政策中将首当其冲，展现出强大的政策敏感度。</p>
<h2><strong>Tepper</strong><strong>：减持阿里，但中国科技股调整仍占主导</strong></h2>
<p>曾豪言“买入一切中国资产”的<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">对冲基金大佬David Tepper</a>一季度减持了261万股阿里巴巴，持股减少了22.06%。</p>
<p>然而，阿里和拼多多仍然稳居其投资组合的前两位，占比分别达14.56%和6.17%，第五位的京东占比也达到3.95%，意味着中概股在其前五大持仓中占据了三席，反映了Tepper对中国资产的谨慎乐观情绪。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/6f94d4ef-dc26-4563-9366-1ab986f8e428.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="739" data-wscnw="1024"/></p>
<p>除了减持阿里巴巴，Tepper还减持了46万股微软，持股减少47.42%，并完全清空了AMD的120万股持仓以及联邦快递的35万股。</p>
<p>Tepper去年9月曾表示，中国市场的股票比美股便宜太多，且中国推出宽松政策的力度超预期，这种&#34;调整但仍占主导&#34;的策略，展示了他对中国数字经济的长期信心依然存在。</p>
<h2><strong>Renaissance</strong><strong>：大幅增持Robinhood，看好加密货币前景</strong></h2>
<p>由已故Jim Simons创立的Renaissance Technologies今年开局强劲，其旗下Renaissance机构股票基金截至4月上涨12.73%，Renaissance机构多元化Alpha基金上涨16.75%。</p>
<p>尽管Renaissance没有改变其顶级持仓，但做了一些调整。该公司将其最大的美国股票多头头寸Palantir Technologies减持了28%以上。Palantir在季末约占其美国普通股资产的2%。</p>
<p>Renaissance在前三个月最重要的多头押注是将Robinhood Markets的持股增加了37%以上，使其成为公司第四大美国普通股多头头寸。</p>
<p>Robinhood正继续深入加密货币市场，特别是在周二宣布已同意收购加拿大的WonderFi Technologies之后。这一增持可能表明Renaissance看好加密货币交易平台的发展前景。</p>
<h2><strong>盖茨：巴菲特退休前，减持伯克希尔</strong></h2>
<p>虽然比尔·盖茨并非专业投资人，但这位老牌首富的投资组合同样值得关注。</p>
<p>盖茨的三大持仓依次为微软、伯克希尔·哈撒韦和废弃物管理公司——这个组合既有高科技，也有价值投资和必需服务，显示出他对投资多元化的重视。</p>
<p>值得注意的是，盖茨在一季度小幅减持了伯克希尔·哈撒韦的股份。这是否意味着他对巴菲特退休后公司的发展前景持有疑虑？</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  大幅扩赤字，共和党这份减税案，美债吃得消吗？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">美国税改法案将在未来十年增加至少4万亿美元赤字，恐给债市埋下“大雷”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在全球贸易局势缓和之际，美国国内财政问题正悄然酝酿更大风险。据追风交易台消息，巴克莱银行的最新研报显示，<strong>众议院版本的税改法案实际将为美国十年赤字增加约4万亿美元。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">而当前，美国的赤字已处于GDP的6.5-7%的水平，这一法案将进一步推高长期美债收益率，给债券投资者带来沉重打击。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">随着关税问题暂告段落，投资者的焦点转向正在国会推进的税改法案，以及它对美国长期赤字可能带来的影响。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">赤字注定继续攀升，法案将在未来十年增加4万亿美元赤字</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据巴克莱的分析，美国财政政策长期存在的问题之一是国会通过“花招”使赤字预测显得更小，比如减税通常前置，削减支出则后置。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">目前的税改法案延续了这一趋势。据媒体报道，周二，众议院筹款委员会标注了该法案的众议院版本，<strong>该法案延长了即将到期的《减税与就业法案》(TCJA)，从而在未来十年内增加了近3.8万亿美元的赤字(超过现行法律)；它还通过增加国防和移民执法支出，增加了3200亿美元的赤字。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">法案通过各种措施回收了1万亿美元税收，如取消电动汽车税收抵免、IRA抵免、《平价医疗法案》支付等。但随后，该法案又通过总统要求的新减税——如不对小费和加班征税、提高标准扣除额等——增加了1万亿美元赤字。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在支出方面，该法案计划在未来十年减少1.3-1.4万亿美元支出。其中大部分(超过9000亿美元)应该来自能源和商业委员会，该委员会对医疗补助拥有唯一管辖权，对医疗保险拥有联合管辖权。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告称，如果参议院没有改变现有措辞，该法案似乎会在未来十年增加约2.5万亿美元赤字(不包括利息支出)。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">更令人担忧的是，新提出的减税措施预计于2028年到期，这使成本“仅”为1万亿美元。但历史经验表明，<strong>国会很可能在2029年延长这些到期的减税措施。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">负责任联邦预算委员会(CFRB)估计，将这些新减税延长十年——这可能是进行这项分析的正确方式——将为美国赤字增加另外1.5万亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>这意味着，该法案在未来十年的成本膨胀到4万亿美元。</strong>随着利息支付也将上升(随着低成本债务的到期)，美国债务/GDP状况在未来几年“似乎没有稳定的机会”。</p>
<h2>美国财政状况不容乐观</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据巴克莱的报告，2024财年，美国借款规模超过2.5万亿美元，到2025财年，这一数字似乎有望降至2.1万亿美元以下。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告称，从数字上看这是一种改善，<strong>但这一数字被美联储减少量化紧缩的事实美化了。</strong>随着今年从美联储资产负债表上到期的债券减少，财政部的借款需求表面上有所改善，此外还有财政部现金余额变化的问题。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>在考虑这两个变量后，报告称，2025财年美国财政部的真实融资需求接近2万亿美元，略高于2024财年。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告指出，考虑到美国税法是累进制的，当经济增长放缓时，税收往往会低于预期，如果2025年美国经济增长明显弱于去年，赤字将进一步扩大。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告总结称，<strong>即使不考虑税改法案落地带来的赤字增加，在经济良好时期，美国的赤字似乎“注定”至少要占GDP的6.5-7.0%；在经济衰退的情况下，赤字将大幅增加。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">债券市场“瑟瑟发抖”</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #333333;">报告指出，尽管今年的GDP增长肯定会低于2024年，美国债券收益率却已连续数周上升。这部分是因为对2025年通胀的担忧，部分是由于外国投资者将一些资本从美国资产转移出去，部分是因为在关税缓和后，经济衰退的风险似乎已经避免。</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">但长期利率期限溢价上升的部分原因可能是因为美国没有努力控制不断上升的赤字。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告进一步指出，<strong>投资者越担心赤字，长期利率就越高，这推高了未来的利息支付，反过来又导致债券投资者更加担忧——如此循环往复。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美国长期债券已接近自全球金融危机以来的最高水平。随着市场消化新税改法案的细节，并意识到赤字很可能在可预见的未来继续上升，长期收益率也有继续上升的风险。</p>

Title:  David Tepper一季度：增持Uber、Meta，清仓AMD，减持阿里、微软 
Description:  <p>曾豪言“买入一切中国资产”的对冲基金大佬David Tepper在一季度减持了阿里，但在其前五大持仓中，中概股仍占据三席。</p>
<p>据最新提交的2025年第一季度13F文件，Tepper旗下对冲基金Appaloosa Management一季度大幅调整其投资组合，包括增持Uber和Meta，减持阿里巴巴和微软，清仓AMD和联邦快递，建仓德银和博通等。</p>
<p>去年9月，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3729048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tepper曾公开表示</a>，中国市场的股票比美股便宜太多，且中国推出宽松政策的力度超预期，之前已经全面购入了几乎所有中国大型科技股，接下来对中国股票的投资限额可能将翻倍。</p>
<h2>Tepper投资组合一览：中国科技股依然占主导</h2>
<p>尽管减持了阿里巴巴的股份，Tepper仍然对中国科技公司保持了显著敞口，其投资组合最大的两个头寸依然是中国公司。</p>
<p>根据最新的13F文件显示，截至2025年第一季度， Tepper的投资组合包括38只股票，其中阿里巴巴集团仍然是其最大持仓，占投资组合的14.56%，而拼多多位居第二，占比6.17%。投资组合前五大持仓还包括亚马逊(5.7%)、京东(3.95%)和Meta Platforms(3.78%)。</p>

Title:  财报后股价大跌，大摩发声：阿里云的增长逻辑没有变化！ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">财报后股价大跌，但大摩认为阿里云战略完好，变现能力持续增强，市场的预期过高。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">周四晚，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">阿里公布的财报显示，</a>集团第四财季营收同比增长7%但不及预期，净利润同比大幅增长。业绩发布后，阿里股价下跌约8%，明显跑输大盘。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，摩根士丹利Gary Yu及其团队于周四发布研报称，尽管阿里最新财报略低于华尔街期望，但其阿里云的增长逻辑依然稳固，将继续受益于AI行业爆发性需求增长。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告中，大摩维持了对阿里巴巴的“增持”评级，维持目标价180美元不变。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">市场对云业务的预期过高，其增长逻辑依然稳固</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据大摩分析，<strong>阿里的股价下跌主要源于市场对阿里云业务20%增长的过高预期，</strong>但实际公布的18%增速符合大摩的预测。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg4MTUyNzI1Mg==&amp;mid=2247558690&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=4b7e8693f3a5d300137027f8bfa09b20&amp;chksm=cea72cfb6a6c0ddf3dd2b0fd2e7dc8b34cc1ff29d7728eb1eee98a6847958642d3200e69698c&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=23&amp;srcid=0516HMUTbwiekhBeKqEHFlKz&amp;sharer_shareinfo=ca0a6d3a54cf3820cdfb5460ac96a24a&amp;sharer_shareinfo_first=ca0a6d3a54cf3820cdfb5460ac96a24a#rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">海豚投研分析指出</a>，<strong>现在仅靠“阿里云是AI时代最达受益者”这个故事就能吸引投资者的阶段显然已经过去。阿里云的估值要进一步走高，就需要实际增长beat市场当前预期，</strong>促使市场拉高预期后再beat新预期的循环，进而形成不断上调的业绩预期，和进一步估值扩张的共振。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩认为，<strong>阿里云第四季度出现的春节季节性因素和供应链波动掩盖了其真实增长潜力。</strong>根据报告，AI相关产品收入连续第七个季度保持三位数增长，这一趋势极具投资吸引力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩认为，阿里云的投资逻辑依然稳固，主要基于以下因素：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>行业需求超过供应</strong>：阿里作为唯一专注外部云业务的服务提供商将从行业繁荣中受益；</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>千问模型的协同优势</strong>：阿里开源的千问3模型既有端侧应用，也有云端应用，二者相互配合增强客户粘性；</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AI基础设施持续投入</strong>：尽管短期可能影响利润率，但将支撑长期增长。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告还援引CEO吴泳铭在财报电话会上的发言指出，阿里云未来几个季度营收增速仍处于“上升通道”，管理层对此抱有“强烈信心”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，阿里管理层还在电话会上透露了两大关键趋势：一是在大中型企业中，AI应用从内部系统向用户侧场景渗透；二是AI产品用户从大中型企业延展到大量中小企业。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">吴泳铭在电话会上解释：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“新的客户需求，大部分是推理应用或推理场景推动，而实际上他们真正的大规模上线可能是在后面几个月逐渐上线。也许是2月份、3月份，甚至4月份、5月份。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩预计，<strong>阿里云在2026财年第一财季（下一季度））将实现22%的收入增长，这将成为股价回升的重要催化剂。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">电商业务：变现效率持续提升，AI加持前景广阔</h2>
<p>四季度，阿里淘天集团(TTG)的客户管理收入(CMR)在第四季度实现12%的增长，显著超过分析师预期的9%。</p>
<p>大摩指出，<strong>CMR增速继续领先于GMV增长，这一趋势预计将至少持续两个季度，</strong>主要得益于0.6%服务费的实施以及全站营销渗透率的提升。</p>
<p>报告预计，阿里巴巴的GMV增长将与行业保持同步，其战略是通过在淘宝天猫平台嵌入AI功能提升用户参与度和使用频率。预计F1Q26 CMR将增长10%，核心业务调整后EBITA增长6%，这已考虑了对内容、用户获取和补贴的再投资。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">阿里估值仍处合理范围内</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，阿里在过去12个月已回购约119.9亿美元股票，并宣布2025财年每股美国存托凭证2美元的股息(常规1.05美元+特别0.95美元)，总计分红46亿美元。按照报告，阿里去年向股东共返还165亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩预计，<strong>2026财年阿里总收入同比增长8%，客户管理收入增长7%，云收入增长25%。集团调整后EBITA预计增长10%</strong>，尽管考虑到AI和本地服务的增加投入，但将被淘天持续货币化和其他业务亏损收窄所部分抵消。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告还表示，目前阿里的F2026年预期市盈率仅为12倍，而大摩的目标价意味着16倍F2027年市盈率，仍处于合理估值范围内。</p>

Title:  黄金 VS 比特币-- 一场“零和博弈”已形成 
Description:  <div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<p>今年上半年，市场见证了一场引人注目的资产重新配置过程：原本在2024年第四季度同步上涨的黄金与比特币，如今已演变为一场&#34;零和博弈&#34;。</p>
<p>据追风交易台消息，摩根大通本周在研报中写道，自4月22日黄金价格达到3500美元的峰值后，已下跌近8%，而同期比特币价格上涨了18%。<strong>这种此消彼长的格局预计将持续至年底，但多项加密货币特有的积极催化因素可能使比特币在下半年表现优于黄金。</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/30f48617-e6c1-4c1a-a2d5-7eaf05e00c78.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="680" data-wscnw="1039"/></p>

<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="49fb2c86">资金流向印证黄金与比特币的&#34;翘翘板&#34;效应</h2>
</div>
<p>摩根大通表示，<strong>最近三周的资产流向数据清晰地展示了这种此消彼长关系。</strong></p>
<p>散户和私人投资者的行为显示，实物黄金和现货ETF出现资金外流，而比特币/加密货币ETF则经历资金流入。期货市场也呈现类似趋势：黄金期货持续下滑，比特币期货却大幅增长。这与今年2月中旬至4月中旬期间的关税事件相反，当时黄金强势上涨，而比特币与风险资产同步下跌。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/775f7d4b-3fab-434d-81f4-4d8edd396f63.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="627" data-wscnw="388"/></p>
<p>对此摩根大通分析称，2024年第四季度美国大选前后，<strong>黄金和比特币曾同步上涨，表现出共同的&#34;货币贬值交易&#34;特征。</strong>然而，进入2025年后，这种协同效应已停滞，转变为两者之间的零和博弈。</p>
<p>2月中旬至4月中旬，黄金上涨是以比特币下跌为代价；而过去三周则出现相反的趋势——比特币上涨伴随着黄金下跌。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="9f47be75">“特有的”多重催化剂支撑比特币上涨势头</h2>
</div>
<p>摩根大通认为，比特币在今年下半年的表现将优于黄金，对此他们提出除了从黄金下跌中获益外，比特币还受益于多项加密货币特有的积极因素：</p>
<p><strong>1、企业增持趋势</strong></p>
<p>MicroStrategy、Metaplanet等公司积极增持比特币。MicroStrategy宣布计划到2027年再筹集420亿美元（总计840亿美元）用于购买比特币，其初始420亿美元的&#34;21/21&#34;计划已完成60%。</p>
<p><strong>2、美国州政府投资入场</strong></p>
<p>新罕布什尔州成为美国首个通过法案允许州财政投资加密货币市场的州，授权将高达5%的州资产投资于比特币和黄金。亚利桑那州也采取预算中性方法为比特币和其他数字资产建立储备基金。随着更多美国州可能考虑将比特币添加到战略储备中，这可能成为比特币的持续利好因素。</p>
<p><strong>3、衍生品市场成熟化</strong></p>
<p>美国加密货币交易所收购加密衍生品平台，如Coinbase收购占全球加密期权交易85%的Deribit，Kraken收购美国期货平台Ninja Trader，Gemini获得MiFID II许可证以在欧元经济区提供衍生品。这表明加密衍生品市场正在成熟，并通过纳入美国或欧盟监管，可能增强传统机构投资者的信心和参与度。</p>

Title:  关税对美国通胀影响要来了！沃尔玛带头涨价，其他零售商也会效仿 
Description:  <p>关税风暴下，沃尔玛确认即将迎来史无前例大幅涨价，全美零售业或将跟进。</p>
<p>5月15日，全球零售巨头沃尔玛在发布超预期季度财报的同时，向市场发出了一个明确信号：关税引发的价格上涨即将来袭。<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">沃尔玛警告称</a>，由关税引发的价格上涨预计将很快波及货架上的商品，公司将从本月开始上调部分商品价格。</p>
<p>沃尔玛首席财务官约翰·戴维·雷尼在接受采访时表示：“如果你还没有看到（价格上涨），它将在5月发生，然后会变得更加明显。” <strong>雷尼直言：“这些价格上涨的幅度和速度将是前所未有的。”</strong></p>
<p>雷尼进一步表明：“<strong>如果某物有30%的关税，你很可能会看到两位数（的价格上涨）。”</strong></p>
<p>作为服务90%美国消费者的零售巨头，沃尔玛是迄今为止规模最大的暗示日常用品将因关税上涨价格的公司。分析认为，沃尔玛此举将打开零售业全面涨价的闸门。</p>
<h2>零售业涨价的闸门可能已经打开</h2>
<p>根据Axios报道，GlobalData董事总经理Neil Saunders认为，“<strong>如果一个以低价为核心的玩家如沃尔玛都在提价，这解释了为什么其他零售商可能会跟进。</strong>沃尔玛对此很诚实，这鼓励其他零售商也进行公开对话。”</p>
<p>事实上，其他公司已经宣布涨价计划。福特汽车上周宣布将提高旗下三款畅销车型的价格。奢侈品牌爱马仕也表示，美国市场的价格将上涨。下周，Target、Lowe&#39;s和家得宝将公布业绩并讨论其财务预测，投资者将密切关注他们是否会跟随涨价潮。</p>
<p>沃尔玛CEO Doug McMillon在财报电话会议上提到了“零售业微薄利润的现实”，并表示：“<strong>鉴于关税的规模，即使在本周宣布的降低水平下，我们也无法吸收所有压力。”</strong>这意味着，即使中美达成将额外关税从145%降至30%的临时协议，价格上涨仍然不可避免。</p>
<p>Nagarro数字工程公司首席技术官Ram Reddy表示，他预计电子产品和玩具将是沃尔玛价格上涨的主要类别。与此同时，McMillon表示沃尔玛将尽可能保持食品和消耗品价格“尽可能低”，但来自哥斯达黎加、秘鲁和哥伦比亚等国家的关税正在对进口商品如香蕉、鳄梨和咖啡施加压力。</p>
<p><strong>如果连打着“省钱让生活更美好”口号的沃尔玛都难以维持低价承诺，美国消费者和整个零售业可能面临一场前所未有的价格风暴。</strong></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title:  到瓶颈了？Meta将推迟发布旗舰AI模型Behemoth，盘中跌超3% 
Description:  <p>周四，据媒体报道，扎克伯格旗下Meta Platforms推迟发布旗舰AI模型Behemoth。Meta的工程师们在显著提升其大型语言模型Behemoth的能力方面遇到困难，员工们质疑其相较前代模型的进步是否足以支撑公开发布。</p>
<p>在还处于早期开发时，<strong>Meta内部计划于4月发布Behemoth，</strong>以配合Meta首次为开发者举办的AI大会。Meta在该活动前发布了Llama AI模型系列中的两个小型模型，<strong>但更大的Behemoth版本发布被推迟至6月。现在，该模型发布时间又被推迟到秋季甚至更晚。</strong></p>
<p>需要注意的是，扎克伯格及其他Meta高管并未公开承诺Behemoth的发布时间。公司最终可能决定提前发布Behemoth，包括推出一个功能受限的版本。但Meta的工程师和研究人员担心其表现不符合此前对外宣称的能力。</p>
<p>Meta曾公开“吹捧”Behemoth的能力，声称其在某些测试中已经超过OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的同类技术。但内部人士表示，该模型的性能受制于训练过程中的困难。</p>
<p>Meta发言人拒绝对此置评。</p>
<p>Meta将推迟发布旗舰AI模型Behemoth，<strong>引发了内部对于其数十亿美元AI投资方向的担忧</strong>。Meta计划今年资本支出最高可达720亿美元，其中大部分将用于实现CEO扎克伯格在AI方面的宏伟目标。</p>
<p>下图为Meta的资本支出情况：</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/09f90396-6f79-487c-9fda-f27be761c3de.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="292" data-wscnw="500" data-wscnsize="15319"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>下图为大型科技公司近年来的资本支出趋势，市场担心这种趋势并不可持续：</p>

<p> </p>
<p>周四的消息出炉后，Meta股价盘中跌超3%，英伟达盘中也出现明显回落，并且拖累纳指当日收跌。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/633a0d58-bdb9-4f87-91dd-50ec66d39623.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="867" data-wscnw="1280" data-wscnsize="106989"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Meta不满AI产品组表现</h2>
<p>Meta的第一代Llama模型由其基础AI研究团队开发，该团队主要由博士研究人员组成，并于2023年初对外发布模型及研究论文。然而此后，<strong>参与该论文的14名研究者中已有11人离开Meta公司。</strong>后续Llama模型则由另一团队开发。媒体报道称，Meta近期的一些Llama模型也存在问题。</p>
<p>4月发布的两个Llama模型起初在一个受欢迎的AI聊天机器人排行榜上表现良好，但后来被发现，提交至排行榜的并非公开发布的同一模型。</p>
<p>排行榜的代表称，Meta应更明确地说明他们提交的是一个针对测试进行过优化的定制模型。扎克伯格承认，Meta提交给排行榜的AI模型是专门优化过以便在第三方测试中取得好成绩的版本。</p>
<p>据知情人士称，<strong>Meta公司高层对开发Llama 4模型的团队表现感到失望，并将Behemoth进展缓慢归咎于该团队。因此，Meta正在考虑对其AI产品组进行重大管理调整。</strong></p>
<h2>未来AI模型的进步可能会比以往慢得多</h2>
<p>Meta此前因快速追赶全球AI竞赛对手而受到赞誉，并在此过程中投入巨资，开发在WhatsApp、Instagram和Facebook上的聊天机器人技术。</p>
<p>Meta推迟发布旗舰AI模型Behemoth，凸显其当前面临的困境，也反映出其他顶尖公司在发布下一代AI先进模型过程中遇到的挫折或延误。一些研究人员认为，<strong>这种趋势表明未来AI模型的进步可能会比以往慢得多，且成本极高。</strong>“目前来看，各个实验室、各种模型的进展都非常小。”</p>
<p>OpenAI的下一代重磅模型GPT-5原本预计在2024年中期发布。去年12月，报道称该模型的开发进度落后于计划。今年2月，OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman表示，将发布的是GPT-4.5，而GPT-5这一寄望于实现更大技术突破的模型还需数月时间。ChatGPT目前运行的是GPT-4o版本。OpenAI拒绝就GPT-5的发布时间发表评论。</p>
<p>Anthropic去年宣布正在研发名为Claude 3.5 Opus的新模型，是其去年发布并持续更新的AI模型的更大型版本。该模型目前仍未发布，一位发言人表示“即将推出”。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p data-start="554" data-end="614">另外，伯克希尔在第一季度清仓了其持有的Nu Holdings股份，后者运营着巴西数字银行Nubank，清仓规模为4000万股。伯克希尔将其在Liberty Formula One的投资削减了约一半，降至350万股。</p>
<h2 data-start="554" data-end="614">苹果仍是第一大持仓</h2>
<p data-start="554" data-end="614"><strong>目前，苹果公司仍是伯克希尔最大的单一持仓，持有3亿股，占其整个股票投资组合约25%。</strong>虽然伯克希尔此前已大幅削减了苹果持仓，但根据最新13F文件，伯克希尔第一季度并未进一步减持。截至3月31日，伯克希尔所持苹果股票市值为666亿美元。在5月2日举行的伯克希尔年度股东大会上，巴菲特对苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）的领导能力给予高度评价。</p>
<p data-start="554" data-end="614">除苹果之外，伯克希尔的另外几大持仓分别是美国运通、可口可乐、美银、雪佛龙。</p>
<p data-start="860" data-end="974">媒体分析认为，整体来看，这一季度巴菲特及其两位投资经理托德·康布斯（Todd Combs）和泰德·韦施勒（Ted Weschler）在股票上的买卖操作相对较少。康布斯与韦施勒共同管理着伯克希尔约10%的股票投资组合，其余部分由巴菲特亲自负责。</p>
<p data-start="976" data-end="1036">伯克希尔旗下许多规模较小（市值在20亿至30亿美元以下）的持仓由康布斯或韦施勒管理，他们通常独立于彼此及巴菲特进行操作。</p>
<h2 data-start="976" data-end="1036">有保密持仓存在</h2>
</div>
<div data-v-cf751a50="" data-v-c1a393be="" data-v-41d6eebc="">
<p data-start="651" data-end="734">本月早些时候，巴菲特在伯克希尔股东大会上宣布，他将于年底卸任伯克希尔首席执行官一职，震惊了众多股东。他将把权力交棒给既定继任者格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel），自己则继续担任公司董事长。</p>
<p data-start="651" data-end="734">美国大型投资者每季度结束后45天内须向SEC提交13F表格，披露其长期持仓情况。这些文件受到市场密切关注，以便投资者了解大机构的最新动态。13F表格中信息有一定滞后性，也不一定完整。提交者无需披露空头仓位，所列出的持仓也可能只是更大规模交易的一部分。不过，市场观察人士仍会仔细分析伯克希尔的13F文件，以洞察巴菲特及其投资副手最近的操作动向。</p>
<p data-start="171" data-end="296"><strong>同时，伯克希尔还向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）提出了保密请求，要求对一项或多项股票投资暂不披露在13-F报告中。</strong>媒体分析称，这很可能是出于巴菲特的意愿，毕竟作为伯克希尔股票投资组合的掌舵人，他希望在不引起市场注意、不推高股价的情况下继续悄悄增持某些股票。</p>
<p data-start="298" data-end="354">此前在巴菲特增持保险公司丘博（Chubb）股份期间，伯克希尔也曾提出类似的保密请求，并最终在2024年公开了该项持仓。</p>
<p data-start="356" data-end="475"><strong>有媒体根据伯克希尔5月早些时候发布的第一季度10-Q文件分析，如果此次新增的保密持仓仅为一只股票，其投资规模相对较小，约在10亿至20亿美元之间。这项新投资很可能属于伯克希尔所称的“商业与工业类”股票投资组合。</strong></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="587">根据伯克希尔的财报，该公司在第一季度净卖出股票，买入股票总额为32亿美元，卖出总额则为47亿美元。伯克希尔持有的现金和美国国债总额已升至创纪录的3330亿美元（扣除为购买部分短期国债而预留的应付款项后）。市场观察人士一直密切关注巴菲特何时会将这笔巨额资金投入市场。</p>

Title:  特朗普全面围攻藤校！哈佛被指遭司法部调查，共和党提案变相增税、打击招收国际生 
Description:  <p>从司法调查到税收狙击，特朗普政府正通过一系列前所未有的法律和税收手段对哈佛等精英大学施压。投资者应警惕，教育领域可能面临的监管风暴和高校基金会投资价值急剧变化的风险。</p>
<h2>司法战线：哈佛面临&#34;虚假申报&#34;调查</h2>
<p>特朗普政府正在将一项通常用于惩罚政府承包商欺诈行为的法律武器对准哈佛大学。</p>
<p>美东时间5月15日周四，据媒体报道，美国司法部于本周一致信通知哈佛大学，该部门根据《虚假申报法》对该校招生流程是否用于欺骗政府展开调查。媒体认为，这种援引《虚假申报法》针对大学的行动极为罕见，反映了特朗普政府越来越激进的策略。</p>
<p>如果经调查被认定有罪，哈佛大学将不得不向政府返还资金，并可能面临数亿美元的罚款。司法部要求哈佛在三周内提供大量文件并回答一系列详细问题，包括任何讨论特朗普今年早些时候旨在消除多元化、平等和包容计划的行政命令的短信、电子邮件或其他通信。</p>
<h2>多管齐下：政府对哈佛的全面围攻</h2>
<p>这只是特朗普政府攻势的一部分。教育部本月早些时候也通知哈佛大学，其招生政策正在接受合规审查，以确定该大学是否对本科申请者进行种族歧视。</p>
<p>一个多月前，哈佛批评，特朗普政府的要求侵入性过强，并表示不会遵守。此后，特朗普政府已针对该大学发起至少八项调查和其他行动：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>国土安全部威胁阻止哈佛招收国际学生；<br/>教育部指控哈佛未如法律要求报告大额外国捐赠；<br/>平等就业机会委员会启动调查，调查哈佛是否歧视白人、亚裔、男性和异性恋申请者；<br/>教育部和卫生与公众服务部开始调查《哈佛法律评论》对种族偏好的使用；<br/>特朗普威胁撤销学校的免税地位；<br/>政府表示将终止约4.5亿美元的研究资金。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>税收重拳：共和党提出捐赠基金分级征税、计算公式不再计入国际生</h2>
<p>与此同时，特朗普所在的共和党内，共和党议员正在税收领域对财富依赖捐赠基金的藤校发起新一轮共计。美国众议院筹款委员会的共和党议员本周公布一项新的提案，计划按大学学生的人均捐赠基金规模，分三档征收投资收益税，大学面临的税率可能从目前的1.4%提高到14%、甚至21%。</p>
<p>该提案规定：</p>
<ul>
<li>每名全日制学生人均捐赠基金超过200万美元的私立大学，投资收益将按21%的税率缴税。</li>
<li>每名学生人均捐赠基金在125万至200万美元之间的大学，投资收益应缴税率为14%。</li>
<li>每名学生人均捐赠基金在75万至125万美元之间的大学，投资收益应缴税率为7%。</li>
</ul>
<p>不仅如此，该提案还修改了税收计算公式，国际学生不再被计入计算上述人均捐赠基金的学生基数。媒体认为，这可能打击哥伦比亚大学等多所高校，这种调整旨在阻止高校招收来自美国以外国家地区的学生。</p>
<p>哥伦比亚大学拥有约150亿美元的捐赠金，现有约3.6万名学生，其中包括估计1.4万名国际学生，以3.6万的人数均摊，该校可以避免2017年特朗普第一个任期内出台的高校捐赠金收益税。而根据共和党的提案，计算学生人数的公式只包括有资格依据美国《高等教育法》获得联邦财政援助的学生、主要是美国公民和永久居民，哥伦比亚大学就得缴税了。</p>
<h2>政治动机：超越反歧视的更广泛议程</h2>
<p>特朗普与哈佛的冲突是其更广泛努力的一部分，旨在重新定义传统民权斗争的参数，并重组他所认为的精英大学校园的自由倾向。</p>
<p>众议院筹款委员会副主席Vern Buchanan在声明中确认，委员会已将他的《保护美国学生法案》纳入国会正在考虑的更大税收方案中。他表示：&#34;太多&#39;精英&#39;大学已经忘记了为美国人民服务的使命。他们不优先招收来自我们自己社区的学生，而是追逐外国招生资金，对校园抗议活动视而不见。&#34;</p>
<h2>哈佛指责政府滥用权力</h2>
<p>哈佛大学发言人Jonathan Swain表示，学校致力于遵守法律，并且符合最高法院的决定。他称政府的行动是&#34;又一项滥用和报复性行动——是政府针对哈佛发起的众多行动中的最新一项&#34;，并补充说政府的行动&#34;将对我国的健康、经济繁荣和科学领导力产生灾难性后果&#34;。</p>
<p>哈佛于本周二修改了针对特朗普政府的诉讼，称政府的手段已经“加码”，&#34;加紧资金削减、调查和威胁，这将伤害来自全国各州和世界各地的学生&#34;。根据该大学的说法，过去一周内至少有六个联邦部门和机构发出了关于终止拨款的通知。</p>
<p>随着这场权力之战的持续升级，投资者应密切关注这些举措对私立大学基金会管理、国际学生招募策略以及高等教育整体投资环境的潜在影响。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  “新美联储通讯社”：美联储将对利率制定框架调整，承认长期低利率可能已结束 
Description:  <p>周四，美联储主席鲍威尔表示，鉴于新冠疫情后的通胀和利率前景发生了重大变化，美联储正着手调整其整体的政策制定框架。“自2020年以来，经济环境发生了重大变化，我们的审查将反映我们对这些变化的评估。”</p>
<p><strong>有“新美联储通讯社”之称的知名财经记者Nick Timiraos撰文称，面对不再确定是否有超低利率的世界，鲍威尔引导新战略。美联储即将对利率制定框架进行调整，虽然不太可能影响当前的政策决策，但承认了“长期低利率”时代可能已经结束。</strong></p>
<p>Timiraos解释说，鲍威尔所说的“框架”是指，美联储制定利率政策的整体战略：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>美国国会赋予美联储的职责是保持低且稳定的通胀，同时促进就业市场健康发展。而如何实现这些目标，主要由美联储自行决定。自2012年以来，美联储通过一份框架声明来阐述其实现这些目标的方式。</p>
<p>美联储目前的政策框架是在五年前采纳的，并于今年开始对该框架进行审查。此次审查预计不会影响美联储当前的利率决策。鲍威尔此前曾表示，可能在8月或9月完成该审查过程，并公布结果。</p>
<p>鲍威尔在周四的讲话中暗示，美联储将撤回五年前制定的一些关键变化。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timiraos援引当日鲍威尔讲话，划了一些要点发言：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>鲍威尔指出，2020年疫情后出现的更高的实际利率（即经通胀调整后的利率）可能使当前框架中的某些要素失去意义。</p>
<p>更高的实际利率可能反映出未来通胀可能比2010年代的危机间时期更具波动性。我们可能正进入一个供应冲击更加频繁且可能更持久的时期——这对经济和央行而言都是一个艰难的挑战。</p>
<p>在上周的会议中，（美联储）官员们认为，应修订五年前采纳的“平均通胀目标制”。有意允许通胀适度超标的想法在政策讨论中变得无关紧要，至今仍是如此。</p>
<p>如果公众不相信通胀会回落到疫情前的水平，那么我们不可能在不伴随失业率飙升的情况下，实现最近的通胀下降。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>鲍威尔是在美联储位于华盛顿的总部举行的一场研究会议上发表上述讲话的。Timiraos指出，在会议上，官员们听取领先政策理论家的建议，讨论美联储可能对其政策框架和沟通工具进行的调整。</p>
<p>Timiraos在文章中写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>美联储每六到八周召开一次会议，对是否调整利率进行投票，并发布政策声明说明决策原因。而此次框架审查关注的是另一份文件，该文件通常每年1月重新发布，阐述美联储设定利率的基本方式。</p>
<p>美联储于2012年正式设定了2%的通胀目标。但在2007–2009年金融危机后，全球长期处于低利率环境，使官员们担忧这一目标存在缺陷：在利率经常接近零的情况下，美联储在经济下行时可能缺乏刺激增长的手段。</p>
<p>因此，美联储在很多情形下更容易通过加息来抑制经济过热，而在经济疲软时刺激经济则变得更困难。六年前，美联储展开了首次“框架审查”，为期一年，目的是针对这一不对称性的应对策略。</p>
<p>在鲍威尔的领导下，美联储于2020年采纳了一项新的政策框架，进行了一个看似微小但重要的改变。当时，即使在极低的利率环境下，通胀也低于2%的目标。因此，美联储采取了一种“补偿”策略：即使模型建议更高的利率，他们也会保持较低利率，允许通胀略高于2%的目标。官员们同意每五年重新审视该框架。</p>
<p>2021年疫情后的经济重启，使得2020年框架中的主要变革失去了适用性。2021年11月，美国通胀达到6%。这种“超标”是由强劲需求和混乱的供应链推动的，而这些情况并未在该框架制定时被预见。</p>
<p><strong>美联储此次审查，是对2020年框架不足之处的反思——尤其是它未能适应一系列广泛的经济情境，即便这些情境当初看起来不太可能发生。</strong></p>
<p><strong>不过，这次审查预计会保留美联储框架中的核心理念，包括2%的通胀目标，以及确保公众相信美联储将维持通胀低且稳定这一关键任务。</strong>官员们认为，这种通胀预期具有自我实现的特性，是过去两年在不显著增加失业的前提下实现通胀下降的主要原因。</p>

Title:  十万亿银行股“市值狂飙”，公募私募“措手不及”？ 
Description:  <p>银行板块在近期的快速上涨，甚至连行业内人士也不太了解其背后的原因。</p>
<p>但这就是事实，浦发银行、上海银行、江苏银行、农业银行、工商银行、成都银行、建设银行、中国银行等一批银行纷纷创下A股上市以来最高点。</p>
<p>以工商银行为例，该行最新复权价格超过7.2元，妥妥的超过了当年上证指数6000点时的高峰股价（下图）。</p>
<p>这还只是近期银行股飙升的一个缩影。</p>
<p>由WIND编制的A股银行指数（涵盖了A股42家上市银行）于近日创下历史新高，且A股银行板块总市值盘中突破10万亿元大关。</p>
<p>在经历了漫长的被“质疑”、被“低估”、被“漠视”之后，银行股似乎真的开始进入一轮前所未有的“价值发现之旅”。</p>
<p>而对于A股市场而言，这样十万亿级的大行业的“估值中枢”的调整，必将是一件牵涉巨大、兹事体大的事情。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/458d64f3-fbd8-4d05-98cf-7ab6ae7b5915.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="291" data-wscnw="865" data-wscnsize="212280"/></p>
<h2>“铁树”开花</h2>
<p>2025年5月14日，A股市场内的银行股板块迎来里程碑时刻——板块总市值突破10万亿元，创下历史新高（下图）。</p>
<p>这一数字不仅昭示了近年银行业在国民经济中核心地位进一步巩固，更折射出多股市场合力之下，银行股为代表的“大金融板块”正面临前所未有的“重估契机”。</p>
<p>以代表性的工商银行为例，2006年10月上市的该股，今年恰好进入第20个自然年。</p>
<p>过去近20年里，工行从2016年的最低价上涨了7.16倍（即增长为最低价的8.16倍）</p>
<p>如果粗略的把工行的20年行情划分为三次翻倍行情的话（不考虑6000点超级波动行情）。</p>
<p>大约是，前九年（2014年末前）翻了第一番；</p>
<p>又八年（2022年末前）翻了第二番；</p>
<p>接着三年内，翻了第三番。</p>
<p>部分银行股在悄然间，已默默实现了“价格发现”。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ae2554e9-8a3b-4269-b557-33c8ab03c813.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="328" data-wscnw="865" data-wscnsize="218273"/></p>
<h2>政策“红利效应”</h2>
<p>从市场角度看，银行股的“重估”恰好一定程度上符合当下的经济发展时代。</p>
<p>有观点认为，银行股本轮的估值快速修复始于2023年的政策转向。</p>
<p>一方面，随着房地产行业风险逐步“出清”，政策层面通过“三个不低于”定向输血房企、保障房收储置换隐性债务等举措，显著改善了银行资产质量预期。</p>
<p>另一方面，2025年“新国九条”的出台，对投资者回报的重视被提到了空间高度。各项规定纷纷倡导和强调上市公司分红与股东回报，后者亦与银行股高股息特性高度契合。</p>
<p>其三，《保险资金运用管理办法》修订后，保险投资权益类资产的风险因子放宽，并可以使用OCI等模式对长期持有的权益资产进行成本计价，后者推动险资对银行股的配置需求激增，仅2025年上半年，保险业内至少已有5次举牌银行股的记录。</p>
<h2>“稳定市场预期”的抓手</h2>
<p>另一个不得不提的情况是，近年以汇金为代表的类“平准基金”的积极入市，稳定市场预期的操作。</p>
<p>后者大概导致至少10000亿元的新增申购，投向以沪深300指数ETF为代表的各类宽基ETF中。</p>
<p>而众所周知的是，银行为代表的大金融板块，在宽基中占比很大。</p>
<p>以业内最大的指数基金华泰柏瑞沪深300ETF（510300）为例，该基金近年1季度末持有各类金融股818亿元，占基金组合的24%。</p>
<p>也就是说，每4元钱新增申购，就有1元钱要投向大金融。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/36f12bee-00be-4f2d-a703-a0ea3fb2ffba.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="508" data-wscnw="865" data-wscnsize="467781"/></p>
<h2>公募“新考核机制”不可忽视</h2>
<p>另一个潜在的巨大影响因素，是公募基金考核机制的改革。</p>
<p>根据最新发布的“推动公募基金高质量发展行动方案”中要求的，未来主动权益类基金的考核将高度绑定“长期基准表现”。</p>
<p>这意味着，以往几乎完全不顾“基准”指数的投资风格很可能遭到打击，越来越多的基金经理开始重视其净值与基准的对比。</p>
<p>后者，很有可能推动基金经理重视对金融股和银行股的投资。</p>
<p>以常见的沪深300指数为例，最新一季度末，大金融股权重占比为24%，长期低配银行股的数万亿主动权益基金，或有可能“重新重视”金融股。</p>
<h2>公募配置过“冷”</h2>
<p>那么公募基金对银行股的配置究竟有多少欠账呢？</p>
<p>华福证券研报指出：从个股维度看，主动偏股型公募基金对绝大多数银行股目前都处于低配状态。</p>
<p>数据显示：2024年末主动偏股型公募基金对A股上市银行的配置仅占其持仓市值的2.97%，远低于银行在以沪深300为代表的业绩比较基准中的权重。</p>
<p>开源证券则给出今年以来的“配置不足”数据：截至今年3月末，主动权益持仓银行股比例3.75%，相较沪深300低配约10个百分点。</p>
<p>华泰证券还指出了重点欠配的方向：主动权益基金深度欠配银行板块，国股行尤其突出。</p>
<p>其中，主动偏股型公募基金重仓银行板块占比3.8%，较沪深300、中证800指数中13.7%、9.7%的权重明显低配。</p>
<p>这家卖方团队测算指出：招行、兴业、工行、交行、农行、浦发等沪深300成分股，主动权益基金对此持仓偏离度均在0.5%以上，对应欠配资金达到80-210亿元。</p>
<p>长江证券最新认为：在银行板块系统性修复估值的进程中，预计资金面对红利资产的追逐，以及指数权重的因素，将共同推动相关银行股上涨。</p>
<h2>私募低配“旗鼓相当”</h2>
<p>资事堂注意到：主动选股的股票私募对银行也处于低配状态。</p>
<p>华润信托的统计显示，截至2025年3月末，百亿规模股票私募重点配置的五大行业依次为资本货物、消费品、材料、技术设备、食品饮料。银行板块则排在第八位，对应比例不及3%，低于2024年同期。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/fdf15745-365e-4863-b0ed-d384ad2258c8.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="525" data-wscnw="865" data-wscnsize="155755"/></p>
<p>上文曾提及，主动偏股公募产品重仓银行板块的比例为3.8%，微微领先于私募同行。</p>
<h2>私募明星多数“不爱银行”</h2>
<p>纵观中国基金经理群体，不乏多位明星基金经理曾因重仓银行而成名，但如今的投资重点早已转移。</p>
<p>公募基金经理中，曾在兴全基金担纲主力的董承非在早年投资生涯中，曾因前瞻重仓银行股而备受好评。但最新他管理的私募产品的配置已经移向了半导体。</p>
<p>国内价值型基金经理中，能够给与银行股一定权重的基金经理也不多，历史上偏好银行股的丘栋荣等也早早的退出了公募一线。</p>
<p>目前国内基金经理中，似乎只有广发基金的王明旭等少数基金经理常年对银行股有一定配置。基金季报显示，王明旭管理的广发内需常年保持了30个点左右的银行股配置。</p>
<p>私募行业内，常年对银行股始终保持明确配置的私募基金经理较少，主要以少数派投资周良、高毅资产邱国鹭为代表。</p>
<p>其中，周良在今年初路演时透露：今年大盘蓝筹股是一个配置方向，市场无风险收益率快速下行的过程中，投资价值凸显。包含了银行、家电、汽车等投资价值凸显。</p>
<p>私募机构中，更不乏明确表示“抛弃”银行股配置的基金经理。半夏投资李蓓就是一例。</p>
<p>她在5月份发文指出：鉴于相关因素，当前持有银行股风险大于收益，过去一年多半夏投资持有超10%银行股，近期已减仓大部分，后续择机减至0。</p>
<p>银行股的强势表现能否持续尚待观察，但公募基金为代表的机构重视基准，重新认识金融股的配置价值的过程，或许已不可避免的展开了。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  小米自研手机芯片来了！雷军官宣5月下旬发布，十年“造芯”重大突破 
Description:  <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">小米十年造芯道路即将开花结果，自研SoC芯片&#34;玄戒O1&#34;本月就将发布。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">继苹果、三星、华为后，小米成为全球第四家拥有自研手机SoC的手机品牌。此举不仅标志着中国科技企业在芯片自主化道路上的又一重大突破，也将成为推动小米股价上涨的四大催化剂之一。投资者可密切关注5月底芯片发布及其后的小米股价表现。</p>
<h2>自研芯片浮出水面，小米正式加入&#34;造芯俱乐部&#34;</h2>
<p>5月15日晚，小米集团创始人、董事长兼CEO雷军通过社交媒体正式宣布：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;和大家分享一条消息：小米自主研发设计的手机SoC芯片，名字叫玄戒O1，即将在5月下旬发布。感谢大家支持！&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ea7faa76-c31c-4bcb-9942-a58aa6b1802a.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="415" data-wscnw="729" data-wscnsize="18493"/></p>
<p>这一消息标志着小米正式加入全球手机自研SoC芯片的精英俱乐部，成为继苹果、三星、华为后，全球第四家拥有自研手机SoC的手机品牌。</p>
<p>上证报称，继2017年推出首款自研芯片澎湃S1后，这是小米时隔八年再次发布手机主控芯片，彰显了小米在半导体领域持续投入的决心和成果。</p>
<h2>十年造芯之路：从澎湃S1到玄戒O1</h2>
<p>小米的自研芯片之旅始于2014年10月，当时小米成立了全资子公司北京松果电子，正式开启手机芯片研发之路。2017年2月，小米发布了首款自研SoC芯片澎湃S1，采用28nm工艺，搭载于小米5C手机，但市场反响有限。澎湃S1因技术瓶颈和供应链问题未延续。</p>
<p>此后，小米被传出澎湃S2流片失败，核心系统级芯片进展一度放缓。但小米并未放弃芯片研发，而是调整策略，先从专用芯片入手：2021年推出了自研影像芯片澎湃C1和充电管理芯片澎湃P1，2022年又推出了澎湃G1电池管理芯片，通过推出小芯片逐步积累经验。</p>
<p>据上证报，此次玄戒O1的研发团队规模超1000人，独立于小米主体运营，由前高通高管秦牧云领衔，高规格保密且高层直接督导。此前市场有消息称，小米已在手机部产品部组织架构下成立芯片平台部，任命秦牧云担任负责人。</p>
<h2>SoC芯片：手机的&#34;大脑&#34;与&#34;神经中枢&#34;</h2>
<p>SoC（System on Chip，即片上系统）芯片是决定手机性能的核心组件。根据证券时报的描述，它宛如一座&#34;微型城市&#34;，集成了CPU（中央处理器）、GPU（图形处理器）、DSP（数字信号处理器）、RAM（内存）、Modem（调制解调器）、导航定位模块等多个功能模块，让手机在有限的体积内可以实现丰富功能。</p>
<p>北京社科院副研究员王鹏向证券时报表示：&#34;自研芯片可以更好地满足手机厂商对于性能和独特技术优势的需求，提升手机竞争力。同时，也能让手机厂商降低对供应链的依赖，为手机厂商提供更强的供应链掌控力。&#34;</p>
<h2>&#34;玄戒O1&#34;背后的玄戒技术公司</h2>
<p>玄戒O1芯片的名称来源于其研发主体公司。企查查数据显示，北京玄戒技术有限公司成立于2023年10月26日，注册资本为30亿元，执行董事为曾学忠。</p>
<p>曾学忠于2020年加入小米集团，曾负责手机产品的研发和生产工作，现任小米集团高级副总裁兼国际业务部总裁，分管互联网业务部。他具有丰富的通信和芯片行业经验，曾任中兴通讯高级副总裁兼中国区总裁、中兴通讯执行副总裁兼中兴终端首席执行官，还曾担任紫光集团有限公司全球执行副总裁、紫光股份总裁以及紫光展锐CEO等职位。同时，他也是中国集成电路设计产业技术创新战略联盟副理事长。</p>
<p>据企查查数据，2025年以来，北京玄戒密集申请与芯片相关的公开发明专利。仅5月13日本周二，该公司就申请了名称为&#34;芯片封装方法、芯片封装结构和电子设备&#34;在内的10项公开发明专利。目前该公司公开专利达115件，类别涵盖电通信技术、基本电器元件、基本电子电路等，其中113件专利处于审核中。</p>
<h2>小米股价催化剂：四大利好因素推动</h2>
<p>德意志银行分析师Bin Wang在<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747055" target="_blank" rel="noopener">最新研报</a>中表示，小米股价的回调为投资者提供了良好的买入机会。该报告认为，接下来两个月内有四大关键催化剂可能推动小米股价反弹，自研手机芯片就是其中之一。这四大股价利好分别是：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>2025年第一季度财报</strong>：德银预计小米2025年一季度销售额将同比增长9%，达到75869辆，智能电动汽车及新业务的毛利率将环比增长至22%，一季度总收入约为1090亿元人民币，经调整净利润为100亿元（同比增54%，环比增20%）。</p>

Title:  阿里的AI转型与进化 
Description:  <p style="text-align: right;">作者 | 小 猫</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">编辑 | 硬 AI<strong> </strong></p>
<p>观察近期科技巨头的财报，一个显著的共同点是AI投入的急剧增加及其对增长驱动的逐步显现。</p>
<p>亚马逊CEO Andy Jassy在财报电话会议中多次强调，AWS的增长源于企业对AI的旺盛需求，并表示“AI将成为亚马逊未来几十年最大的业务之一”。Meta将AI列为核心战略，扎克伯格强调AI正驱动广告业务的精准度和效率提升。</p>
<p>行业共识正在形成，AI已从前期的“实验性探索”阶段，大步迈向了驱动增长的“经营杠杆”阶段。“全年百亿美金”级别的算力采购与AI研发投入，正成为顶尖科技玩家的常态。</p>
<p>阿里巴巴在这一轮科技转型中展现出同样的战略眼光。市场认知随之发生转变——阿里不再仅是中国领先的电商平台，<strong>而是一家具有全球竞争力的科技企业</strong>，其战略重心正向AI倾斜。</p>
<p>这一转变不仅体现在企业战略定位上，<strong>更在技术进化和产业应用等方面得到印证</strong>。</p>
<h2><strong>科技公司的底色</strong></h2>
<p>5月15日，阿里巴巴公布2025年Q4财报，集团剔除大润发和银泰外整体收入同比增长10%，云智能业务收入同比增长18%，增速较前季度的13%进一步提升，值得注意的是，对外商业化收入同比增长17%，公共云收入增长继续加速。</p>
<p>更引人关注的是，<strong>AI相关产品收入已连续7个季度保持三位数的同比增长，科技业务已经成为公司新的增长引擎</strong>。</p>
<p>公司此前宣布未来三年将投入<strong>超过3800亿元Capex</strong>用于升级云计算和AI基础设施——这一金额超出过去十年的相关投入总和。</p>
<p>这与全球科技巨头在AI资本开支曲线上进入S型中段的趋势相吻合，即大规模、持续性的AI基础设施投入已成为行业标配。</p>
<p>本季度，公司Capex 246亿元，公司在电话会中表示：全球AI供应链存在一些不确定性，但客户需求的增长是确定性的。我们看到客户对云和AI的需求在持续增长，这是未来10-20年的历史性机会，不会因为供应链短期波动而变化。阿里巴巴投入云和AI基础设施的信心和决心不会改变。</p>
<p>面对确定性AI需求带来的巨大潜力，此前大摩预计阿里云收入增速将在2026财年加速至25%。由此，AI驱动的科技业务在可见范围内将给阿里带来更多增长动力，真正成为一家全球领先的科技公司。</p>
<h2><strong>登顶最强开源模型，保持阿里科技的全球竞争力</strong></h2>
<p>顶尖的科技公司，技术实力是立身之本。</p>
<p>阿里在AI领域的积累集中体现在其自主研发的通义千问（Qwen）模型系列上。</p>
<p>4月底，阿里开源发布新一代通义千问模型Qwen-3（千问3），参数量仅为DeepSeek-R1的三分之一，成本大幅降低，但性能全面领先，一经发布，成功登顶多个全球权威开源模型排行榜，并被迅速采纳进全球各大开发社区和企业。</p>
<p>除模型性能外，阿里巴巴坚定不移的<strong>开源战略</strong>扮演了至关重要的角色。将视线投向更远的未来，阿里巴巴CEO吴泳铭已在多个公开场合明确将“追求AGI的实现”作为集团AI战略的首要目标。开源就是这背后的战略考量。</p>
<p>首先，在通往AGI这一人工智能终极目标的漫长征途上，没有任何一家企业或组织能够独自包揽所有创新与突破。</p>
<p>开源，是汇聚全球智慧、加速技术迭代、共同分摊探索风险的有效途径。通过将核心模型开放给全球的开发者、研究机构和企业，阿里能够构建一个充满活力的Qwen生态系统。</p>
<p>其次，开源社区的集体智慧能够催生出超越单一组织边界的创新应用和模型变体。</p>
<p>截至2025年4月底，基于通义开源模型的衍生模型数量已超过10万个，全球累计下载量更是突破3亿次，这充分证明了开源生态的强大生命力与创造力。</p>
<p>在可以预见的未来AGI世界，智能的形态极有可能是分布式的，多种智能系统将基于不同的优势交叉验证、协同进化，共同推动社会整体智能水平的提升，而开源正是培育这种多元化智能生态的沃土。</p>
<p>再者，通过开源，让更广泛的用户能够便捷地使用和改进模型，可以更快地发现模型的潜在问题与不足，收集更多元化的应用场景反馈，从而加速模型向更通用、更强大的AGI方向进化。从这里不难看出阿里的技术野心。</p>
<p>在AI的征途上，重要的或许并非在当下就精确定义出AGI的终极形态——因为“没人能在现在就定义好终极形态”——而是在<strong>将AI技术广泛应用于千行百业、深度融合于真实场景的过程中</strong>，不断积累宝贵的数据、持续优化核心算法、快速迭代模型能力，让AI在解决一个又一个真实世界问题的过程中，不断试错、学习、进化，最终涌现出真正的通用智能。</p>
<h2><strong>AI落地千行百业，是追求AGI的必然路径</strong></h2>
<p>随着AI应用从模型训练阶段大规模转向推理部署阶段，对云计算资源的需求正呈指数级增长。阿里云凭借其领先的技术实力和庞大的规模优势，成为承接这一历史性需求的核心平台，也用技术实力支撑起AI在千行百业加速落地。</p>
<p>在财报分析师电话会上，阿里CEO吴泳铭分享了AI领域的两大最新趋势：一是在大中型企业，AI应用开始从内部系统向用户侧场景渗透；二是积极使用AI产品的客户，从大中型企业延展到大量中小企业。AI产品的行业渗透率正在加速扩大，除了比较快使用AI产品的互联网、智能汽车、金融、在线教育外，很多传统行业，如养殖业、传统制造业等，也都在积极探索AI应用。</p>
<p>AGI的通用性，又决定了AI模型只有在真实、复杂的产业环境中，面对具体而迫切的业务痛点，不断接受实践的打磨和数据的反馈，才能真正进化出强大的泛化能力和实用价值。</p>
<p>在<strong>汽车行业</strong>，阿里与<strong>宝马</strong>等全球领先汽车制造商的战略合作，以及<strong>小鹏、蔚来、极氪</strong>等国内新能源车企在智能座舱系统中对通义千问的积极接入，均标志着阿里AI技术在汽车智能化浪潮中的深度参与和价值贡献。</p>
<p>在<strong>通信行业</strong>，阿里与<strong>中国移动、中国联通</strong>等电信运营商的战略携手，旨在共同构建AI产业新生态，积极推动AI与5G、算力网络等前沿技术的融合创新与应用拓展。</p>
<p>阿里财报电话会还披露，近期中国工商银行正式选择阿里云PolarDB数据库作为其全行级交易型分布式数据库。这既是顶级企业对阿里云技术能力的认可，也反映出阿里在积极推动AI产品在产业落地。</p>
<p>以及最让人津津乐道的与苹果公司的合作进展，阿里的AI在各个行业开花落地。这完全符合阿里发展AI的基本逻辑。5月13日大摩唱多阿里，指出阿里是中国最佳AI“赋能者”，作为独特的GPU服务提供商，阿里AI加速产业落地，广受市场期待。</p>
<p>如果说对AGI的远征是阿里巴巴仰望的星空，那么将AI的强大能力深度融入千行百业的真实场景，构建可持续的商业价值闭环，则是其脚踏实地的万里长征。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  资金轮动明显，黄金与比特币呈现 “零和博弈” 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通指出，随着“去美元化交易”陷入停滞，黄金与比特币之间呈现“零和博弈”的局面。4月22日以来，金价在达到3500美元的峰值后已下跌近8%，而比特币价格同期上涨18%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/497f1259-dc29-414b-85f5-280ee5dfd211.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="801" data-wscnw="1344"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这种反差也反映在资金流动上。据追风交易台消息，摩根大通最新报告指出，<strong>过去三周，黄金ETF出现资金流出，而比特币和加密货币ETF则吸引资金流入。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通预计<strong>，今年剩余时间黄金和比特币之间的“零和博弈”将会持续，倾向于认为加密货币特定催化剂将在下半年为比特币创造更多上行空间。</strong>报告指出，除了从黄金流出的资金支持外，比特币还受益于多项加密货币特定催化剂，包括MicroStrategy等公司增持、新罕布什尔州通过法案允许州财政投资比特币。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="37782c6b">避险资产大逆转</h2>
</div>
<p>报告指出，2024年第四季度，金价与比特币价格曾呈现同步上涨态势，特别是在美国大选期间及其后，市场对美元贬值的担忧推动两种资产共同受益。然而，进入2025年后<strong>，这种“去美元化”交易明显停滞，转变为金价与比特币之间的“零和博弈”关系。</strong></p>
<p>反映在资金流向上有三大特点：</p>
<ul>
<li>从实物黄金和现货比特币/加密货币ETF的资金流向看，过去三周黄金出现资金流出。</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a7de71de-2212-4741-bf88-3dd268047dea.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1048" data-wscnw="1269"/></p>
<ul>
<li>同期比特币/加密货币ETF则录得资金流入</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/2e6c1b79-c82d-4dcf-aaa2-b5b767e2e759.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="973" data-wscnw="1248"/></p>
<ul>
<li>期货持仓数据显示，黄金期货持仓继续下降，而比特币期货则出现明显增加</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/57c50614-a2b5-4f69-b116-cf29caf61517.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1041" data-wscnw="1266"/></p>
<p>资金轮动与市场环境的变化密切相关。摩根大通指出，今年2月中旬-4月中旬期间的关税紧张局势推动了黄金强势上涨，而比特币则与风险资产一起表现疲软。而在过去三周，随着市场风险偏好的改善，该趋势完全逆转。</p>
<p>这也表明，在特定市场环境下，投资者会在这两类避险资产之间进行轮动配置：</p>
<ul>
<li>关税紧张期间：黄金上涨，比特币下跌。</li>
<li>风险偏好改善期间：黄金回调，比特币上涨。</li>
</ul>
<p>摩根大通预计，黄金与比特币之间的零和博弈关系将延续至2025年剩余时间，但基于加密货币特有的催化因素，下半年比特币可能较黄金具有更大上升空间。</p>

Title:  阿里电话会： 云业务增长主要靠AI需求带动，未来几个季度仍处于上升通道，将把更多淘宝用户转化为即时零售用户 
Description:  <p>5月15日晚，阿里公布2025财年第四季度及全年业绩，财报显示阿里第四季度营收同比增长7%但不及预期，净利润同比大幅增长。其中，淘天营收同比增长9%，88VIP数量持续双位数增长，阿里云季度收入增长18%，AI收入连续七个季度三位数增长。</p>
<p>在随后的财报分析师电话会上，阿里表示：<strong>云业务的营收增速提升到18%，其实最主要的是还是受益于AI相关的需求的带动</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI相关的需求就是连续七个季度有三位数的增长，那这个增长其实大量的都是，就是有很多新的企业都在使用AI服务。</p>
<p>甚至是养殖业，包括是这些制造业，包括我们说到的就是可能是像义乌小商品城这样的这些企业，要在应用AI并服务搬迁到云上面来。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>阿里进一步表示，未来几个季度阿里云的营收增速还在处于一个上升通道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>基于传统的 CPU 的计算，在转向 AI 计算，所以就我们现在看到的情况而言，我们对未来几个季度阿里云的营收增速还在处于一个上升通道，还是抱有一个比较强的信心。</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>阿里指出，推理需求的爆发尚未完全体现在本次财报中：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>新的客户的需求，大部分是他的推理应用或者推理场景推动的这些需求，而实际上他们的真正的大规模的上限可能是在后面这几个月逐渐的上线。</p>
<p>也许是2 月份、 3 月份，甚至 4 月份、 5 月份，所以我觉得后面几个月的增速可能看上去会更接近于预测的正常的工作情况。因为一二三月份有一些供应链的扰动，再加上春节期间的各种供应链的不同情况，所以我们看到推理带动的客户需求还是在持续稳定的往上走。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>即时零售方面，阿里表示：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>未来的一段时间之内，我们的重心会是在，我们会积极的投资，然后我们会把这样的更多的淘宝的用户，会让转变成这样的一个即时零售的用户，然后升级商业模式。</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>最后，阿里表示：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p data-tool="mdnice编辑器">全站推+软件服务费，未来还有相当的一段时间来给增量。一开始的优惠政策，以后也会变成整体的take rate上升；全站推的渗透率，还是增量，新的财年也会有一个正面的影响。</p>
<p data-tool="mdnice编辑器">阿里重点稳定市场份额，所以还会有很多投入，利润率/ebitda不是这段的重点，会随着竞争变化会有利润的波动。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>以下是电话会全文：</strong></p>
<div id="ag-1747310650683">
<p>股东们，我们的董事会已批准每股美国存托凭证1.05美元的年度股息，同比增长5%。这一增长反映了我们股票购买计划的影响，该计划导致本财年ESOP发行后股票数量净减少5.1%。董事会还批准了每股美国存托凭证0.95美元的特别股息，高于去年的0.66美元。这一增长表明我们在处置金融投资中的非核心业务方面取得了实质性进展。<br/><br/>总共，我们的每股美国存托凭证为2美元，今年的现金股息总额为46亿美元。加上119.9亿美元的股票回购，我们在本财政年度向股东返还了165亿美元。<br/><br/>综合而言，综合收入总额RMB2365亿，同比增长7%。排除Sanna和In Time的收入，集团收入将同比增长10%。综合调整后的epita增长36%至RMB326亿，主要归因于收入增长和运营效率的提高，部分被对我们电子商务业务和技术的投资增加所抵消。<br/><br/>我们的非公认会计准则调整后净利润RMB298亿，增长22%。我们的净利润RMB120亿，增加了RMB115.10亿，主要是由于我们的股权投资市场变化、运营收入增加和股权法投资减值减少，部分被出售子公司产生的损失所抵消。本季度经营性现金流为研发275亿，增长18%。本季度自由现金流下降76%至RMB37亿，这主要归因于截至2025年3月31日我们的云基础设施支出增加。<br/><br/>我们继续保持强劲的净现金头寸，RMB3664亿或550亿美元。强劲的净现金状况和健康的经营现金流为我们带来了信心和足够的资源，以增加对云计算和AI基础设施的投资，从而利用持续强劲的需求和最新AI创新带来的巨大增长潜力。</p>
<p>现在我们分业务来看，从淘宝和天猫集团开始，淘宝和天猫集团收入RMB1014亿，增长9%。定制最低收入增长了12%，主要受外卖改善的推动。我们的外卖受益于软件服务费的影响和渗透率的提高，商家通过使用便利性和营销效率的提高受益。我们继续投资于其他战略举措的用户增长，如价格竞争力产品、客户服务、会员计划福利和AI技术应用，以增强用户体验。这些努力带来了更强的新消费者增长势头和订单的持续增长。在商家端，我们仍然专注于改善他们的运营环境，并确保他们在我们平台上的可持续发展。特别是，我们增加了对提供高质量产品和客户服务的商家的支持，包括对营销、新产品发布和客户管理的支持。在本季度，88VIP会员数量继续同比增长两位数，超过5000万人，并以不断增加ARPU，我们将继续关注其留存率。淘宝和天猫商城集团调整后的EBITDA增长8%至RMB417亿，主要是由于定制管理服务收入的增加，部分被用户体验和技术投资的增加所抵消。</p>
<p>本季度AIDC收入增长22%，RMB336亿，主要受跨境业务强劲表现的推动。AIDC调整后的EBITA亏损38.36亿RMB，而去年同期亏损41RMB。AIDC继续专注于提高运营和投资效率，导致本季度亏损收窄。AIDC具有多样化的地理存在。未来，我们将继续通过不同市场的不同商业模式吸引本地商家和合作伙伴，并在动态、宏观和地缘政治环境中导航，以多样化和丰富我们的产品供应。</p>
<p>云智能集团的收入增长了18%，不包括阿里巴巴合并程序的总收入增长了17%，主要是由更快的公共云收入增长推动的。值得注意的是AI相关产品收入连续第七个季度保持三位数的同比增长，我们的AI产品在包括互联网、零售、制造和媒体在内的广泛行业垂直领域得到更广泛的采用，重点是增值应用。四月份，我们推出Qwen3模型系列，这是新一代混合推理模型，将快速、简单的响应和更深层次的思维推理能力结合到一个模型中。Qwen3系列涵盖了全系列的模型尺寸，包括两个Moe模型和六款 Dense 模型，在模型范围上已经完全开源。我们相信Qwen3的完全开源将推动开发人员的创新和新应用程序。云计算调整后的EBITDA同比增长69%，主要是由于公共云产品的快速增长和运营效率的提高，部分抵消了客户增长和技术创新投资的增加。我们将继续投资于客户增长和技术创新的预期，包括AI产品的服务，包括增加AI的采用率和保持我们的市场领先地位。调整后的EBITDA利润率环比下降1.9个百分点。我们增加了对技术和产品开发的投资，以应对AI需求的激增，同时，随着我们加大基础设施投资，投资不断增加，需求不断增长，更高的折旧和变现费用也对利润率产生了压力。</p>
<p>菜鸟的收入下降了12%，其调整后的EBITDA增长了55%。这是物流产品越来越多地融入我们的电子商务业务的结果。受AMAP和Elama的订单增长以及营销服务收入增长的推动，当地服务集团的收入增长了10%，而其调整后的息税折旧及摊销前利润亏损同比继续缩小，因为规模扩大，单位经济因运营效率而改善。我们调整后的EBITDA亏损季度环比增加，主要是由于季节性因素。包括春节假期期间的高投资，数字媒体和娱乐集团的收入增长了12%，达到RMB56亿，主要是由于电影和娱乐业务的强劲表现以及优酷广告收入的增加。EBITDA调整后的息税折旧摊销前利润转为正，主要是由优酷的盈利能力推动的。所有其他部门的收入增长了5%，主要是由于阿里巴巴健康门槛收入的增加，部分抵消了Sunna因2025年2月出售和取消合并而导致的收入下降，而调整后的息税折旧及摊销前利润法亏损RMB25亿。所有其他部分包括一系列创新业务，包括一些战略AI驱动的技术、基础设施和业务。在我们继续推动业务线效率提高的同时，我们也在投资于AI机会，以保持我们的竞争优势并推动未来的增长。</p>
<p>最后，在本季度，我们在提高电子商务在云业务中的竞争力方面取得了重大进展。我们的淘宝和天猫商城实现了稳健的增长，反映了变现效率的提高。在云端，收入增长继续按顺序加速，因为我们看到需求激增和容量增加，我们将吸引更多客户并加速业务增长。我们还专注于提高所有细分市场的效率，以建立一条清晰的盈利路径，随着本季度实现盈利，我们通过将非核心资产和金融投资货币化来加强我们的平衡工作表。这些行动使我们能够更加专注于我们的核心业务，并提供更大的灵活性来广泛投资以实现增长并为股东带来价值回报。我们正在快速而精确地执行，以抓住我在AI时代所拥有的巨大机遇。谢谢你。我们准备好的讲话到此结束。我们可以开放问答环节。</p>
<p><strong>问答环节</strong></p>
<p>大家好。今天的电话会议，欢迎您用中文或英文提问。第三方翻译将为问答环节提供交替传译。请注意，翻译仅供方便之用。如有任何差异，以我们的原始语言管理声明为准。如果您听不到中文翻译，本次通话的双语记录将在一周内发布在我们的网站上。会议结束。<br/><br/>您的第一个问题来自摩根士丹利的Gary。请提问。<br/><br/></p>
<p>问题一：</p>
<p><strong>好的，谢谢，我有两个关于云的问题。首先，我们已经看到，在过去，AI很难实现云计算的货币化。我记得管理层在之前的季度盈利电话会议上说过，超过90%的代币是在云中一起提供服务的。所以首先，在过去的几个月里，我想知道在与您的客户交谈的过程中，您是否看到了这方面的任何重大变化。在过去，你知道，从那些不太愿意进入云的企业开始，因为AI现在正在大力推动进入云。所以我想知道你是否开始看到这种增长。如果有，我想知道这是什么样的公司，哪些行业？如果您能与我们分享一些相关信息，并为FY 26财年提供一些指导。在云服务收入方面，这是我的第一个问题。</strong></p>
<p><strong>第二个问题与AI应用有关，特别是在电子商务领域。展望未来，比如两到三年后，我们预计会在哪里？因为我们是电子商务领域较早开始在电子商务产品中应用AI的公司之一。所以，如果你能提供一些关于新的AI部署能获得多少市场份额的展望，同时，在变现方面，这些新的AI工具会提供进一步的扩张空间吗？谢谢。</strong></p>
<p>回答一：</p>
<p>我们现在就上个季度也有本云业务的营收增速提升到18%，其实最主要的是还是受益于AI相关的需求的这个带动。那 AI 相关的需求就是从数字上我们已经看到连续七个季度有三位数的增长，那这个增长其实大量的都是，就是有很多新的企业都在使用 AI 这个服务。</p>
<p>那我们前面已经讲到过，就是从我们最早接受 AI 的这些服务的企业，可能很多是像我们的互联网，或者说互联网金融、教育或者智能汽车这些最早应用的行业，但是我们确实现在看到很多其他的一些工作场景，包括一些其他的一些公司，就是原来在没有用到 AI 的情况下，他在线下的 IDC， 甚至在公司内部的机房就能解决的这些服务。</p>
<p>但是因为用了AI， 它有强大的动力搬迁到云上面来，所以我们刚才所提到的，像我们提到的这些例子，像甚至是养殖业，包括是这些制造业，包括我们说到的就是可能是像义乌小商品城这样的这些企业，其实他们有相当多的原来在一些线下的workload 都在，因为他们要应用 AI， 所以他们在把他们的这些服务搬迁到云上面来。</p>
<p>那搬迁到云上面来的时候，他们可能会有些简单的一些应用，它可能会调用 API， 但是它要与它的一些企业内部的数据或者企业内部的流程相结合的时候，很多情况下他们都会在做在开源模型之上做一些后训练来满足整个企业的这些需求。那我们看到这样的这些需求，通过百炼，或者说通过在阿里云上租赁我们的整个的那个 GPU 服务和20层的其他的服务，其实它能够很好的满足。所以这个是我对第一个问题的一个回答吧。</p>
<p>我再补充一点，就是我们现在看到的这个行业趋势，越来越多的公司因为 AI 它要使用云服务，然后越来越多的公司它在一些传统的，基于传统的 CPU 的计算，再转向 AI 的，再转向 AI 计算，所以就我们现在看到的情况而言，我们对未来几个季度阿里云的营收增速还在处于一个上升通道，还是抱有一个比较强的信心。</p>
<p>我来回答一下第二个问题，就是关于这个 AI 在电商领域的应用，其实AI在电商领域的应用是非常非常大的一个空间。对，那我们现阶段可能，更加关注就是说AI对于这个用户体验的一个提升。大家都知道其实 AI 有机会去重新构架我们的搜索推荐广告这样的一些过去基于传统算法的这样的一个体系。对，那我觉得这个可能是我们近期内的优先级，那我相信通过这样的一些尝试，我们已经看到了一些结果。那它对于我们在搜索的体验，包括推荐的精准度，还有一些广告效率提升上面都可以看到很显著的一个帮助。</p>
<p>对，那么第二就是说我们也会去关注AI，对于我们内部员工的工作效率的提升，包括商家的工作效率提升，因为大家都知道其实电商是一个人力密集型的一个一个产业，就是除了这个平台之外，这个商家其实也是一个非常广大的一个群体。那我们也相信随着 AI 技术的普及，然后对于这样的一个整体的生态的效率会有一个帮助。</p>
<p>对，然后第三点就是说我们也觉得 AI 长期也会产生新的交互方式。那当这是一个基于创新的这样的一个未来的一种交互的体验，那我们也在积极的去尝试，然后我们也相信就 AI 其实会对于淘宝长期的用户体验、商业效率提升会起到一个非常关键的一个驱动力，谢谢。</p>
<p><strong>问题二：</strong></p>
<p><strong>那我想问关于阿里云增长的这个情况，因为上个季度我记得管理层说了，这个1月以来，这个春节就看到推理需求出现爆发性的增长，那如果我们这么看的话，是否这个二三月比一月是有明显加快？想想看我们看到这个是不是每个月我们的这个云增长都加快？那可能整个季度的 18 个点应该是一二三月的平均嘛？那我们也看到千问的这个模型有一些小而美的一些小模型，也可以做一些端侧应用。那我想问这位我们应该怎么评估这个 AI 模型？但也有大也有小，但因为我们是云端，所以想听一下我们对这个模型变小而美的这个，对我们这个云未来一个增长，推理增长的这个看法，谢谢。</strong></p>
<p>回答二：</p>
<p>好，这个问题我来回答一下。我就您问的那个第一个问题是关于就是在月度的整个营收的这个节奏，那一二三月份里面因为有春节，所以很多节奏其实并不是像正常的月份那么样平均，所以我觉得可能参考性的意义不大，但是就是春节左右的这个季度，确实我们有相当多的客户的，新的客户的需求，这些新客户的需求大部分是他的推理应用或者推理场景推动的这些需求，而实际上他们的真正的大规模的上限可能是在后面这几个月逐渐的上线。</p>
<p>也许是2 月份、 3 月份，甚至 4 月份、 5 月份，所以我觉得这几个应该后面几个月的这个增速可能看上去会更接近于我们可以预测的这个正常的工作情况。因为一二三月份有一些供应链的扰动，再加上春节期间的各种供应链的不同情况吧。对，所以我们看到客户的需求有推理带动的客户需求还是在持续稳定的往上走。那另外一个我们的，您听到的这个 AI 模型对云业务的影响，我们的开源千问的模型确实有很多的，端侧模型的应用也有很多在适合在云端上的。那我们现在看到的情况实际上在很多的，尤其是在 3B 或者说更小一点的规模的模型，可能大规模这类的业务我们大概率我们看到其实主要是应用在客户的一些手机或者说玩具或者智能的设备上面。</p>
<p>这些上面的业务对云业务可能是影响有限，但是因为这些客户在使用千问的这些模型的时候，其实他也往往会需要云端的一些模型的一些配合，它不仅仅是一些端侧的模型才能够会做好这个服务，所以我们看到其实在 32B 以上模型的话，虽然在消费级的显卡上可以跑，但是真正要跑大规模的一些应用的话，可能还是要放到云上来，这样它会有更好的一个更能够适应工作负载的这种弹性，以及更好的一个一个价格。所以我觉得我们的端侧模型某种程度上其实和我们云端的一些大参数的一些模型其实是相互的一个配合的，一个相互配合的一个逻辑，所以我觉得都会拉动我们的客户对于阿里云的相关产品的依赖性。</p>
<p><strong>问题三：</strong></p>
<p><strong>谢谢。请问即时零售要投资100亿，具体的投资计划如何？然后会如何影响到相关的这个盈利能力？</strong></p>
<p>回答三：</p>
<p>对，那我回答一下这个问题，就是其实阿里并不是今天第一天进入即时零售这个赛道，其实我们在这个市场的布局已经有非常多年，我们过去投资饿了，包括我们也做像盒马这样的一些业务，其实都是在布局。对，那其实我们进入这个市场也非常自然的一件事情，当然最近的市场也发生了一些很大的不那话。</p>
<p>当然我觉得讲一下我们进入这个市场的一些原因，就是说包括我们一些优势啊。首先我觉得其实零售这个赛道是非常大的，那它是一个非常广泛的，一个中国老百姓都有的一个需求，那它是一个可能是一个。嗯，现在可能是个五六亿，未来可能是一个10亿用户的需求。对，那么那它也是一个发展非常快的一个赛道。对，那么我们其实认为首先淘宝我已经有一个非常广泛的用户基础。对，那么我们其实也是非常自然的会去把即时零售作为一种新的服务，或者说作为一些新的品类，然后纳入到淘宝这个平台上。</p>
<p>那第二就是说我们进入这个市场，我们有现成的这个商户，非常成熟的商户，因为我们的饿了在就市场已经做了非常多年。对，那我们有非常成熟的物流体系。对，那这样可以让我们在淘宝上去实现这样一个即时零售的体验。那我认为这是我们的一些优势，那基于这些优势，我认为我们可以在非常快的去实现这样一个非常好的体验，同时又在商业效率上面会是一个非常好的平衡。</p>
<p>然后我想讲一下，过去的两周淘宝闪购的这样的一个尝试，其实超过我们的预期的，因为无论从这个规模的增长还是这个效率的体现上面都是好于我们的预期的。那么我们认为这件事情长期会给我们带来多方面的好处，那首先就是说对淘宝这样的一个APP，就是一个电商的APP，那它是一个非常高频次的一个场景，那么我相信在这样的一个，如果我们能在淘宝上建立这样的一个服务，那会让淘宝的活跃度以用户的规模都会有一个长期、更好的一个体现。</p>
<p>未来的一段时间之内，我们的重心会是在，我们会积极的投资，然后我们会把这样的更多的淘宝的用户，会让转变成这样的一个即时零售的用户。 对，那么长期我们相信我们可以基于这样的一个新的业务，然后来重新的升级我们的商业模式，然后以及去让我们的 APP 变得更加的活跃。对，那短期内我们的投资重点主要还是在于刚讲到的新用户上面，就是我们认为淘宝上有一个非常巨大的一个用户的空间，可以让他们去变成即时零售的的用户，所以我们短期内会非常积极的投入这个业务。</p>
<p><strong>问题四：</strong></p>
<p><strong>管理层，晚上好，那个感谢给我这个机会提问我的问题，是因为我们也知道最近我们的 618 活动已经开始了，第一个是想问一下，就是我们今年的 618 活动跟往年可能在一些这个活动安排、预售节奏上有一些不同，不知道今年我们的策略会是怎么样的？然后目前我们看到商户端，用户端有什么样的反馈啊？</strong></p>
<p><strong>然后我的第二个问题是刚刚，其实继续刚刚的那个问题就是我们在即时零售这个领域的话，我们在短期内有没有看到他和我们 618 主站的这个协同，有没有给我们带来一些惊喜的效果啊？那我们怎么看？在这边过去的一两个月里面，我们期待他们会不会有一些什么样的更多的投入跟合作啊？有没有一些比较具体的这个成就，或者是目标想要达成的？谢谢。</strong></p>
<p>回答四：</p>
<p>对，那我再回答一下这个问题，就是刚才讲到即时零售的一个战略方向，那我觉得我们短期内的关注重点还是刚才我讲到就是说怎么样快速转化更多的用户，变成即时零售的用户，那同时在淘宝内端内建立这样的一个心智。那么我们也看到在初步的实验这样的一个结果中，当用户使用即时零售的淘宝闪购这样一个新的服务的时候，我们可以看到它的活跃度是有显著的一个提升的。</p>
<p>对，但我们现在的主要的阶段性的目标还是先把这个业务做好。对，那我认为长期跟电商还是有非常多的结合的可能性的。对，所以回到这个 618 这个问题，可能 618 我们并没有非常刻意的将这个新业务跟电商业务做打通。</p>
<p>然后，回答你一下第二个问题， 618其实是刚开始，然后 618 我们今天还是做了一些改变的，那这些改变包括营销玩法的调整，包括一些节奏上的这种，就是新的一些节奏，那么我们也是希望能够更好的适应新的竞争环境。那么当然也出发点还是希望让消费者有好的体验、好的价格、好的服务。那么我觉得因为这个618还没有开始，那可能我们到下一次的时候给大家汇报 618 的结果会更合适一点。</p>
<p><strong>问题五：</strong></p>
<div><strong>感谢管理总结，我的问题是关于CMR（<span style="text-align: justify;">贡献毛益率）</span>的。能否说明一下季度CMR的提升情况？它与GMV的关系如何，具体是由GMV驱动了多少？另外，它与软件服务费有关吗？在26财年，我们还有哪些杠杆可以进一步提升CMR？本财年CMR预计可以提升到什么水平？另外，关于即时零售方面的投资，是否会增加淘天的利润的压力？谢谢。</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<p>回答： 感谢提问。首先，关于CMR的问题，本季度CMR增长的两个主要因素如下：软件服务费的收取，该费用自去年9月开始实施。全站推的渗透：全站推在广告收入中的渗透率符合预期，并且仍在持续提升。</p>
<p>展望新的财年，这两个因素将继续存在：软件服务费方面：目前仍有部分商家未完全征收，且在推出软件服务费初期，我们给予了部分优惠政策。这些优惠政策将在2025年逐步收回，从而继续推动CMR上升。全站推方面：全站推的渗透率仍在提升，尤其是新加入的中小商家和白牌商家，他们之前未使用我们的广告产品，现在开始使用，这将带来增量的预算和广告收入，从而推动CMR上升。</p>
<p>同时，我们仍需稳定市场份额，因此会继续投入，包括提升用户体验和提供有竞争力的产品价格。目前仍处于投入期，因此贝塔值可能会因竞争态势变化而出现季度波动。过去几个季度的情况也表明了这一点。此外，我们在即时零售等方面的投入，虽然可能会对利润产生一定影响，但也会带来用户增长、频次和粘性提升，从某种角度上替代了之前的市场投入。因此，我们预计淘天的EBITA在未来几个季度仍将因竞争态势变化而波动。关于即时零售方面的投资，是否会增加淘天的利润压力，需要结合具体的投资方向和市场竞争情况来评估。</p>

Title:  关税影响即将到来！沃尔玛警告：我们无法永远维持价格不变 
Description:  <p>全球零售巨头<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">沃尔玛发布了稳健的季度业绩</a>，但同时警告称，<strong>由于关税和日益加剧的经济动荡，公司将从本月开始上调部分商品价格。</strong></p>
<p>财报显示，截至4月30日的季度，沃尔玛美国同店销售额增长了4.5%，调整后每股收益为0.61美元。这一业绩超出了华尔街分析师的预期，表明其通过降低价格以赢得市场份额的策略正在奏效。</p>
<p>然而，反复无常的关税政策阴影笼罩，沃尔玛交易增长有所放缓，销售额也出现波动，杂货和药房销售额保持坚挺，而日用品销售额则出现下滑。更糟糕的是，<strong>由关税引发的价格上涨预计将很快波及货架。</strong></p>
<p>沃尔玛首席财务官John David Rainey在接受采访时表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“如果你还没有看到，它将在5月发生，然后会变得更加明显。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这意味着，依赖沃尔玛低价策略的消费者将很快感受到关税带来的冲击。</p>
<h2>关税阴影笼罩，零售业面临“临界点”？</h2>
<p>尽管公司计划维持全年销售额和利润指引，但由于“正在进行的贸易讨论每周甚至每天都在变化”，公司选择不提供当前季度的收入指引。公司在声明中说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“在当今动态的运营环境中，<strong>缺乏明确性使得对非常近期的预测变得极其困难。</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rainey表示，结果的范围是“相当极端”，公司正在为未来几个月内贸易战和整体经济不景气带来的更大冲击做好准备。</p>
<p>特朗普的关税已经颠覆了各行各业企业的运营。<strong>最近几周，大多数面向消费者的美国公司都报告了疲软的业绩，原因是需求不稳定和经济疲软。</strong>宝洁公司和卡夫亨氏公司削减了年度展望，西南航空公司等航空公司则对即将到来的经济衰退表示担忧。</p>
<p>&#34;现在的零售环境充满挑战，价格上涨如此之快。历史上从未有过价格如此之高、如此之快上涨的先例，&#34;Rainey表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;关税增加的幅度如此之大，以至于零售商无法自己吸收这些成本。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>沃尔玛警告：未来会面临更多关税痛苦</h2>
<p>在各种挑战面前，沃尔玛的定位比其他零售商更有优势。该公司的全球供应链使其能够从多个地区采购产品，而其规模意味着它可以与供应商谈判更好的交易。</p>
<p>尽管沃尔玛表现良好，但仍然警告投资者未来会面临更多关税痛苦，这是一个不祥的信号。</p>
<p>Rainey表示，<strong>与去年相比，本季度销售出现了更大的周间波动，并指出了对短期利润造成压力的因素：关税实施后，公司希望准备好投资于价格，而消费者购买更多利润率往往较低的杂货。</strong>电子、家居和体育用品等类别已经受到冲击，而本季度鸡蛋价格上涨也值得注意。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  美国4月零售销售环比0.1%小幅超预期，消费者支出疲软显露端倪 
Description:  <p>4月份美国零售销售额几乎没有增长，仅上涨0.1%，这暗示了消费者支出开始放缓。即使不包括汽车销售，整体的零售销售额也仅有小幅上涨。</p>
<p>15日，美国商务部公布的数据显示：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>美国4月零售销售：<strong>环比+0.1%，好于市场预期的 0.0%。3 月份的数据被大幅上修至环比增长 1.7%（此前为 1.4%）。</strong>经过修正后，零售销售额同比增长 5.2%，接近 2023 年 12 月以来的最高水平。</li>
<li>剔除汽车销售：环比+0.1%，市场预期：+0.3%；</li>
<li>“控制组”销售：环比-0.2%，市场预期：+0.3%。</li>
<li><strong><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/033e668d-ab95-4628-94e3-416257b0ec48.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="482" data-wscnw="870"/></strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>这一微弱的增长表明，消费者在面对物价上涨和关税带来的担忧时，已经开始减少支出。</p>
<h2 id="7ded0a7f">消费支出刹车，零售销售增长几近停滞</h2>
<p>从行业细分来看，在报告涵盖的13个商品类别中，有7个类别的销售额出现了下降，<strong>其中体育用品、加油站和服装受到的冲击最大。此前一个月出现抢购潮的汽车销售也略有下降。</strong></p>
<p><strong>而建筑材料销售额增幅最大。</strong>唯一包含在零售报告中的服务业类别——餐饮业销售额则连续第二个月出现明显增长。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/25db3a9c-4f9d-4da0-b3d0-f1c73fe48dd2.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="806" data-wscnw="870"/></p>
<p>如果根据通货膨胀进行调整，零售销售额同比增长 2.8%，与 2022 年 2 月以来的最高水平持平。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/832e3ae2-86c5-4cc9-a5a1-d30c42ecc05c.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="479" data-wscnw="870"/></p>
<p>然而，令人担忧的是，直接影响 GDP 的控制组数据环比下降了 0.2%，而市场此前预计将增长 0.3%，为第二季度开局蒙上阴影。亚特兰大联储的GDPNow预测此前预计第二季度增长2.3%，这与年初因大规模的提前进口导致经济萎缩形成了鲜明对比。随着未来几周更多经济数据的公布，这一预测可能会发生变化。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/993a4539-ccae-473b-846e-6a600bb20776.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="483" data-wscnw="870"/></p>
<p>此前，为了抢在特朗普关税政策生效前大量采购商品，消费者似乎已经“透支”了他们的购买力。如今，这些数据表明，消费者正在收紧支出，这无疑加剧了人们对经济增长放缓的担忧。企业、投资者和经济学家对前景都持谨慎态度，因为消费者情绪正在恶化。</p>
<h2>关税影响初现，企业利润承压</h2>
<p>到目前为止，关税尚未引发通货膨胀。4月份消费者价格涨幅低于预期，这表明企业到目前为止尚未急于将更高的关税成本转嫁给消费者。服务价格（如机票和酒店）的下跌也表明，可自由支配的支出有所下降。</p>
<p>然而，另一项数据显示，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747184?keyword=PPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4月份PPI</a>意外下降，降幅为五年来最大，这主要反映了利润率的下降，这表明企业正在承受部分关税带来的冲击。</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">沃尔玛</a>发布了稳健的季度销售额，但表示，关税和日益增长的经济动荡意味着，即使是世界上最大的零售商，也预计将在本月开始提高部分商品的价格。</p>
<p>Energizer Holdings Inc.的首席执行官Mark LaVigne表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“今天动态运营环境缺乏明确性，使得近期预测变得极其困难。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>同时，Nu Skin Enterprises Inc.的首席执行官Ryan Napierski表示，消费者对关税影响的担忧会打击消费信心。Texas Roadhouse Inc.的首席执行官Gerald Morgan则表示，尽管存在担忧，但他们的餐厅仍然座无虚席。</p>
<h2>市场反应</h2>
<p>数据公布后，美元指数短线小幅走低，现报100.79。美股期货短线小幅拉升，纳斯达克100指数期货跌幅收窄至0.5%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/85c76e3c-5a0a-4b04-b107-718125da3661.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="163" data-wscnw="870"/></p>

Title:  美股快速反弹，高盛：短期上涨空间有限、反而回撤风险大，年初的问题全都在 
Description:  <p>在美股近期快速反弹之后，华尔街大行最新警告，市场再次回撤风险大。</p>
<p>据追风交易台消息，高盛在5月14发布的研报中称，尽管关税谈判释放积极信号，市场信心有所恢复，但这并不意味着风险已经消除。</p>
<p>高盛全球股票策略师Peter Oppenheimer指出，特朗普政府的有效关税水平仍然远高于4月2日宣布所谓“对等关税”前的水平，且美股市场仍然面临高估值、市场集中度和增长放缓等风险。</p>
<p>在4月初，美股市场剧烈动荡，标普500指数下跌近20%，纳斯达克下跌23%。随着美英宣布贸易协议，再加上中美贸易谈判远超预期，市场信心恢复，美股也反弹走高。截至本周二，标普500指数收复年内失地，从4月8日的低位反弹了18.1%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/86f504f0-c688-4a03-b897-4f7651c0ea0a.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="543" data-wscnw="1173"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">当下风险是否消失？</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">而且高盛认为，美联储可能不太愿意降息，现在他们预计<span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">美联储开始三次降息的时间将晚于之前预期(12月而非7月)</a></span>。因此高盛在报告中指出：</p>
<p>报告称，投资者首先需要考虑的是，市场经历了什么类型的熊市，或者可能仍处于什么类型的熊市中。</p>
<p>高盛表示，熊市有三种类型。最深和最持久的是结构性熊市，其前兆是资产泡沫，如1980年代后期日本泡沫或全球金融危机。周期性熊市更为常见，通常在经济衰退前出现，而事件驱动型熊市则可能由损害经济的冲击触发。</p>
<p>尽管美国近期可能出现了周期性经济放缓的迹象，但是报告指出，市场最近下跌的主要原因是特朗普总统4月2日的关税公告这一触发事件，许多人担心这将导致经济衰退。Oppenheimer称：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;曾担心最近的下跌会演变成周期性熊市，因为关税威胁打击信心和投资。风险在于，无论最终结果如何，投资者都会认为经风险调整后的衰退概率更高，从而在盈利预期减弱和估值下降的双重作用下推低市场。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>然而，本周中美关税谈判释放积极信号，比投资者预期的更有利于市场。高盛在报告中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;这一点，再加上宣布的美英贸易协议，已经支持了市场，越来越多的迹象表明这次下跌是事件驱动的、暂时的，没有造成持久损害。随着事件本身现在&#39;已解决&#39;，市场正在消除经济衰退风险，并已收复大部分损失。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>随着美股收复年内失地，那么，接下来市场该何去何从？高盛认为：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>尽管在暴跌之后，股市随后调整异常迅速，符合&#34;事件驱动型&#34;熊市特征，但这类熊市的典型走势在初始下跌后通常在一段时间内保持平稳。如果遵循这种典型模式，近期上行空间可能有限，市场可能面临再次回调风险。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>报告并补充道，投资者应该注意风险并未消失，主要存在三个风险点：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1、关税仍比4月2日前高，美国商品进口税率为13%，将会导致经济增长放缓。</p>
<p>2、尽管最新的CPI降温，但是市场认为关税效应将会推升通胀。这可能导致美联储不太愿意降息，高盛目前预计<span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">美联储开始三次降息的时间将晚于之前预期(12月而非7月)</a></span>。</p>
<p>3、如果硬数据恶化，投资者认为出现衰退结果的可能性更高，从而使市场容易遭受另一次调整，这种风险也依然存在。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">市场年初面临的障碍都还在</h2>
<p>报告强调，年初时市场存在的许多障碍已经重新显现，包括高估值、市场集中度以及高风险事件(贸易和AI投资回报等方面)。</p>
<p>从<strong>估值</strong>方面看，随着美股的反弹，估值也有所上升，目前美国市场再次接近历史最高市盈率水平。因此，高盛的资产配置团队对股票持中性立场，并继续增持现金。</p>
<p>从<strong>市场集中度</strong>方面看，当前美股市场的集中度攀升至高位，数据显示，标普500指数前十大成分股的权重已达37.2%，创下1996年以来的最高水平，引发投资者对美股市场回调或波动性加剧的担忧。</p>
<p>从<strong>高风险事件</strong>来看，高盛称，无论接下来的关税谈判结果如何，2025年的关税水平可能会远高于2024年，这不仅冲击经济，还将对企业的利润率造成压力。</p>
<p>关于科技巨头们的AI资本投资回报，尽管美股科技巨头一季度业绩显示盈利强劲，且AI支出没有放缓迹象，但是一些人开始担心，在AI回报仍不高的情况下，科技巨头是否在AI上投入过多。</p>
<p>在报告中，高盛最建议的仍然是多样化投资，一个建议是减少美国投资，特别是随着美元继续走弱，这也会阻碍外国投资者购买美国资产。美国市场的股本回报率仍优于大多数竞争对手，但其优势已达峰值。高盛表示，最近德国、意大利等市场的表现更为强劲。</p>
<p>高盛称，虽然今年关注美国科技股表现不佳，但自2022年利率上升以来，投资机会已转向更广泛的行业、地区和风格组合。以欧洲银行为例，它们曾面临重重障碍，但已开始复苏。</p>
<p>最后高盛表示，投资者应该继续关注能够再投资并随着时间推移产生复合收益的优质成长型公司，以及能通过股票回购和股息增长复合回报的价值型公司。</p>

style="text-align: left">小米YU 7上市在即，能否渡过眼下难关，重塑在消费者心里的形象，是这个车圈新人当前的难题。</p><p style="text-align: left">沉默许久的小米集团创始人、董事长兼CEO雷军，也在近期重新恢复微博更新，这一行为被认为是为小米YU7上市预热做准备。只是，他还是需要直面上述风波，给用户一个交代。</p><p style="text-align: left">小米的当前挑战也给行业一些启示，卷营销进入了新的转折点。在激烈的市场竞争里，汽车行业仍然要回到安全本质，在营销之外，车企更需要注重理性进化。这是中国新能源汽车市场在狂奔多年后，走向规范发展的必经之路。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">风波不断</h2><p style="text-align: left">近两个月的小米汽车，可谓一波未平一波又起，接连陷入争议当中。</p><p style="text-align: left">最近的一桩则是“碳纤维挖孔机盖”维权风暴。起因是首批小米SU7 Ultra的车主提车之后，迫不及待地测试了自己花4.2万元选装的碳纤维挖孔机盖，结果用鼓风机一吹才发现，放在机盖上的纸巾丝毫不动。</p><p style="text-align: left">要知道，在选装时，这是一项顶级跑车才会配备的“黑科技”，可以实现“双风道高效导流”，即可以实现散热与动力下压两项功能。</p><p style="text-align: left">雷军曾在直播中表示：“碳纤维前舱盖，不仅改了外观件，内部结构也改了，双风道直接导向轮毂，支持轮毂散热。”小米汽车官网此前的宣传中也将其描述为“赛道级散热设计”，甚至宣称该设备可以让刹车散热效率提升15%。</p><p style="text-align: left">类似的表述，让用户认为该配置是复刻纽北原型车的功能件，直接吸引用户们为此激情下单。此前，小米在官方微博表述，“碳纤维挖孔机盖”的选配率达到了63%。</p><p style="text-align: left">一系列的测试让已经提车的车主和准车主们大失所望。截至目前，准车主们晒出的维权群中已有超过300人。</p><p style="text-align: left">对此，小米汽车方面也发布致歉声明，称此前信息表达不够清晰：“碳纤维双风道前舱盖在满足复刻外造型的需求之外，提供部分气流导出和辅助前舱散热功能。”</p><p style="text-align: left">对于购车车主，小米早先给出的解决方案是：对于未交付的订单，将提供限时改配服务，可以改回铝制前舱盖；对于已提车和在本次限时改配结束前选配的锁单用户，将赠送2万积分（约合人民币2000元）以表诚意，但未提及是否可以退车。</p><p style="text-align: left">对于这一方案，不少车主并不买账。有车主对华尔街见闻表示，“这是一个信任问题，可以接受仅仅是一个装饰并没有实际作用，但不能接受被欺骗。”</p><p style="text-align: left">除了实际的权益受损，对于50万元以上的车型的消费群体来说，他们也更加在乎情绪价值，而这一次伤害的，恰好就是情绪价值。</p><p style="text-align: left">已经有车主委托律师进行维权。而针对以上争议，有律师表示，若经营者对商品性能、功能的描述与实际效果存在显著差异，可能构成虚假宣传。若市场监管部门认定虚假宣传成立，小米汽车可能面临相应的罚款。</p><p style="text-align: left">华尔街见闻则了解到，小米汽车给车主的最新解决方案，是可以与客服沟通退订，但定金不退。如果车主仍愿意提车，也需要在60日内沟通继续生产，否则视为无提车意愿，订单随即协商取消。</p><p style="text-align: left">5月12日，有一些车主收到了对接客服的反馈。客服表示，申请退车的订单不会继续生产，预计交付周期不再具有参考性，原预计交付周期作废。</p><p style="text-align: left">不少车主对于定金无法退回表示不满。</p><p style="text-align: left">除了挖孔机盖之外，这辆车最近还陷入了锁马力争议。</p><p style="text-align: left">上市之时，这款车的卖点是“1548匹马力、零百加速1.98秒”，但在最近的OTA中，有车主发现，日常驾驶模式下车辆马力被限制至900匹，零百加速性能大幅下滑至2.78秒，解锁全功率需要支付数千元参加赛道考核。</p><p style="text-align: left">之后，小米又是道歉，表示收到反馈后，已暂停了这次推送。不过，与前面的碳纤维挖孔机盖相比，小米在此前就表示解锁最大马力需要“专门的培训和解锁流程”。</p><p style="text-align: left">作为新能源汽车圈最后一位入局者，小米从上市以来的一举一动，都被放置在聚光灯之下，这是多少卷营销的车企们学不来的。但如今，吃完流量的红利之后，小米也没有躲过流量的黑洞。</p><p style="text-align: left">在互联网造神与弑神的周期当中，小米和雷军也需要直面用户质疑，践行此前承诺的以用户为中心，才能持续积累用户口碑。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">智驾争议</h2><p style="text-align: left">小米的这一轮至暗经历，还得从四十多天前的那一场车祸说起。</p><p style="text-align: left">3月29日晚，一辆小米SU7标准版在安徽铜陵遭遇严重交通事故，车辆碰撞后起火，造成驾驶人和两名乘客死亡。</p><p style="text-align: left">消息传出后，“小米回应SU7高速上碰撞爆燃”等相关话题也一度冲上热搜，网友关于该事件中小米智驾以及车门锁死的疑点展开讨论。</p><p style="text-align: left">事故发生两天后，小米公司发言人公布了事发时的车辆行驶数据。根据小米披露，事故前，车辆处于智驾开启状态，车速维持在116码，但驾驶员手脱离了方向盘，系统对此进行了提醒；智能驾驶在事故发生前2-4S左右发出预警，同时减速，驾驶员接管，开始转向减速、避让，但未能实现刹停或换道，车辆以97km/h时速撞上水泥护栏。</p><p style="text-align: left">值得一提的是，这一场事故之后，众多争议如今依旧悬而未决。比如事故中小米SU7检测到了障碍物开始减速，但未公布是否触发AEB刹停；事故后车辆起火原因、车门能否打开等，小米也并未解释。</p><p style="text-align: left">事故之后，小米的股价从今年最高59.45港元/股，一度跌至36.05港元/股，区间跌幅近4成，市值跌破1万亿港元。</p><p style="text-align: left">小米的事故也成为了监管更严格的导火索。让行业原本高调宣传的智能驾驶开始刹车，纷纷改为“辅助”字样，并强调这一功能的边界。</p><p style="text-align: left">4月16日，工信部官网发布公告，称已召开了智能网联汽车产品准入及软件在线升级管理工作推进会，主要汽车生产企业近60位代表参加会议。</p><p style="text-align: left">该公告中还特别要求车企要充分开展组合驾驶辅助测试验证，明确系统功能的边界和安全响应措施，不得进行夸大和虚假宣传，严格履行告知义务，切实担负起生产一致性和质量安全主体责任。</p><p style="text-align: left">在上海车展前后，不少车企和供应商们，曾连夜修改PPT，将“智驾”修改为“辅助驾驶”，并撤掉相关宣传海报等。</p><p style="text-align: left">有不少车企此前就通过智驾能力的不同来定义不同版本，这一次，均对表述进行了修改。比如，理想对于上海车展的新车，此前表述是“智驾焕新版”，修改之后则是“智能焕新版”。</p><p style="text-align: left">对智驾进行改名的车企中，亦有小米。小米方面表示，这一修改是响应国家的号召。</p><p style="text-align: left">经历过这一事件，所谓高阶智驾回归到了智能辅助驾驶的理性阶段。卷安全，成了车企们的新方向。</p><p style="text-align: left">上海车展期间，华为联合广汽、上汽、江汽、奥迪、东风猛士、岚图、深蓝汽车、北汽、阿维塔、赛力斯、奇瑞汽车11家车企发布《智能辅助驾驶安全倡议》。</p><p style="text-align: left">最近，一系列的变化也传导到了销售端。就算在主打L2级智能辅助驾驶的新势力品牌门店，关于这一功能的宣传物料也不见了，销售们也不再主动将这一功能作为主要卖点。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">回归本质</h2><p style="text-align: left">作为最后一位入局的新势力，小米决定造车时，外界对其能否成功就捏了一把汗。</p><p style="text-align: left">直到小米SU7上市前，市场对于小米造车能否成功也质疑声不断，认为这个造车圈的新人，很难一炮而红。</p><p style="text-align: left">后面的故事打破了外界的疑虑，待小米SU7正式上市之后，便一直是顺风顺水，订单、股价、声量，都达到前所未有的高度。从交付第1辆车到交付量达到20万辆，小米用时不到一年，也成为了国内新势力中达成这一目标最快的品牌。</p><p style="text-align: left">小米市值也从小米SU7前徘徊在15港元/股，一路上扬，至今年年初来到59.45港元/股，一年内市值飙升超1.15万亿港元。其中增长的市值，主要来自对汽车业务的乐观预期。</p><p style="text-align: left">摩根士丹利分析师在最新的研报中指出，乐观情景下，小米的电动汽车业务将实现超预期增长，其市销率有望达到3.5-4倍，目标价可能达到75-85港元，对应的目标市值为1.7-2万亿元人民币。</p><p style="text-align: left">但在悲观情景下，小米的电动汽车业务增长不及预期，其市销率可能保持在1-1.5倍，目标价可能降至25-40港元，对应的目标市值为6250-9500亿元人民币。</p><p style="text-align: left">可以看到，小米市值变化的关键变量仍是汽车业务，这取决于汽车能不能持续热销下去。</p><p style="text-align: left">而最近的一系列风波打破了小米的热销神话，也影响着后续车型的发布节奏。</p><p style="text-align: left">上个月，小米汽车交付量环比下降3.4%至2.8万辆，首次出现负增长。当然，短期交付量的下滑并不是最重要的，毕竟小米此前就积累了不少订单，眼下并不愁交付。</p><p style="text-align: left">但对新车节奏的影响似乎是当前最紧要的事。3月底的事故之后，在4月的上海国际车展上，不见雷军和小米下一款新车YU7的身影。根据此前雷军的披露，这款车将在今年六七月上市。</p><p style="text-align: left">而按照行业惯例，年中发布的新车会在4月下旬的上海国际车展亮相。</p><p style="text-align: left">雷军最近恢复更新社交媒体，被认为是为了之后发布新车做准备。但在此之前，小米面临的挑战依旧是如何重新获得用户的信任。</p><p style="text-align: left">并且，当前面临的信任危机和此前行业对其担忧都不相同。信任危机是建立起来更为困难与漫长的软实力，影响范围又极其广泛。毕竟，一旦用户不再信任，订单也不会再流进，别的方面的考验自然也不存在。</p><p style="text-align: left">开始造车之时，雷军表示，“我愿意押上一生的声誉和成就，为小米汽车而战。”如今，一语成谶。雷军和小米的声誉，正在遭受前所未有的质疑。</p><p style="text-align: left">当前的危机与挑战，揭示了汽车行业和手机行业的不同。尽管如今的智能汽车会像曾经的智能手机一样，频繁更新改款，但与手机相比，造车始终还是一门慢生意，且更加考验这个工具边界与下限。</p><p style="text-align: left">从智驾表述的转变来看，小米经历的危机也成为了行业营销的转折点。造车不再是从互联网跨界而来的一群人卷营销，讲故事，而是要让造车回归工业本质，回归工具理性。</p><p style="text-align: left">这场危机展示的也不仅是小米的短板，更是让整个行业开始思考，如何在激进技术与保守安全、流量狂欢与信任沉淀、规模扩张与品质把控之间找到平衡。</p><p style="text-align: left">眼下，小米面临的命题不再是“再造一个爆款”，而是要重新思考汽车这项工具与人本身之间的紧密关系，真诚面对用户，不留信任隐患。之后，才能走向高端，走向全球，“通过15—20年的努力，成为全球前五的汽车公司”的梦想，才能实现。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  今夜，鲍威尔会说什么？ 
Description:  <p>今晚（15日）20:40，美联储主席鲍威尔将在一场活动上致开幕词。</p>
<p>尽管市场普遍期待获得降息线索，但鲍威尔很可能将焦点转向更具实质意义的议题。</p>
<p>有分析认为，<strong>这次演讲的核心将是美联储对其货币政策框架的评估，即如何履行充分就业和价格稳定双重使命的蓝图。</strong></p>
<p>尽管一些经济学家呼吁进行重大改革，但一些分析认为，<strong>今年的框架更新将更加微妙。</strong>预计将进行一些调整，<strong>重点是采取“对称性”的通胀应对方法，并改进美联储的经济预测摘要（SEP）</strong>，许多评论家认为该摘要不够透明。</p>
<h2>与2020年框架大修相比，此次调整将更为微妙</h2>
<p>美联储上次彻底改革其货币政策框架是在2020年。当时，利率接近于零，美联储正在向金融系统注入流动性。</p>
<p>然而，自那以来，情况发生了巨大变化。通货膨胀在2022年飙升至9.1%的峰值，促使美联储采取了40年来最激进的加息行动。</p>
<p>尽管目前物价压力已经有所缓解，但仍高于美联储2%的目标。</p>
<p><strong>这次演讲也恰逢政治压力再次浮现。</strong>周三，特朗普继续“炮轰”鲍威尔，写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“美联储必须像欧洲那样降低利率。太迟的鲍威尔怎么了？这对准备好蓬勃发展的美国不公平？就让一切发生吧，那将是一件美好的事情！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>此外，特朗普的关税威胁笼罩在美联储的所有工作之上，<strong>贸易政策可能会使美联储的工作更加困难。</strong></p>
<p>虽然周四的市场可能不会得到明确的降息时间表，但鲍威尔的讲话可能会为美联储对未来十年的思考提供一个窗口。投资者应该关注美联储对通胀的看法，以及它将如何应对政治压力和潜在的贸易战。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p><strong>2）四季度核心业务进展： </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">淘天集团：收入为710.77亿元，同比增长12%%。其中，客户管理收入同比增长12%，得益于Take rate（佣金率）的提升；</li>

<li style="list-style-type: circle;">国际数字商业集团：收入同比增长24%至276.03亿元，主要受来自速卖通和Trendyol的收入增长所带动；</li>
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">菜鸟集团：收入为人民币215.73亿元，同比下降12%，主要是电商业务承担部分物流平台职责而导致的国内物流服务收入下降所致；</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>此外，受AI和新业务成本拖累，蚂蚁集团利润下降31%</strong>，蚂蚁给阿里贡献了17.6亿元人民币利润。据媒体测算。考虑到阿里持有蚂蚁集团三分之一的股份，这意味着在截至12月末的三个月里，蚂蚁集团的利润估计为53亿元。在前一财季，投资收益推动蚂蚁集团利润飙升逾50倍。蚂蚁集团的业绩比阿里晚一个季度。</p>
<p>阿里巴巴集团首席财务官徐宏说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>本季度业绩强劲增长，集团整体收入同比增长7%，整体EBITA同比增长36%。我们对业务前景充满信心，将坚定加大投入核心业务，巩固业务优势。我们持续践行提升股东回报的承诺，2025财年我们已回购119亿美元股份，使得流通股净减少5.1%。同时董事会已批准派发年度和特别股息合共46亿美元。</p>

Title:  星纪魅族把AI手机的价格打到了594元 
Description:  <p style="text-align: right;"><img class="wscnph" title="" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/d89cfb80-965f-41ca-b140-12dca244f965.png" alt="" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnsize="1498158" data-wscnh="1138" data-wscnw="1700"/>作者 | 黄昱</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">编辑 | 刘宝丹</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">喊出“All in AI ”一年多以来，星纪魅族进行了大刀阔斧的改革，也在今年明确了手机产品矩阵的规划。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2025年，将是星纪魅族完整AI手机产品线走向市场第一年。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">作为首发产品，5月13日，魅族Note 16系列AI手机终于面市。魅族Note 16系列定位千元国民级手机，比魅族21 Note定价更低，入门款魅族Note 16参与百大职业专项补贴后，8GB+128GB 版本售价699元，国补价更低至594.15元。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note系列是魅族一直有的产品线，2014年作为魅族旗下魅蓝品牌的第一款产品推出。去年魅族21 Note上市，标志着魅族Note系列在沉寂五年后回归。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI功能无疑是Note 16系列的最大看点，也是其能否在中低端市场站稳脚跟的关键。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">据悉，魅族Note 16系列搭载了Flyme AIOS 2操作系统，全方位焕新的AI语音助手Aicy已深度接入阿里云首个端到端全模态大模型 Qwen-Omni，能理解对话者情绪并做出更自然更流畅的回应。同时也接入了满血版 DeepSeek-R1 模型，支持深度思考和联网搜索。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">此外，Flyme AIOS 2操作系统的图库新增了AI 超清、路人消除在内的多项图片修复能力；新增的 AI 妙绘功能只需用户通过文字描述，即可对中选区域重新生成对应的画面。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在媒体交流会上，星纪魅族中国区CMO万志强表示，星纪魅族的手机产品线现在就是两条，一条是数字系列，另一条就是Note 系列。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">之所以最终确定这两条产品线，万志强解释道，魅族需要在旗舰产品上发奋图强，延续“美而强的精品神话”，再造魅友心中的信仰灯塔，这是魅族的A面，也是今年夏天发布会的魅族22系列的使命。 同时魅族也需要走出舒适圈，让先进的技术惠及大众，完成AI平权的时代使命，这将是魅族B面。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">魅族品牌这些年来经历了不少风雨，在2023年重生为星纪魅族后，一直在探索新的产品线组合。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">去年初，星纪魅族成为第一个跳出来宣布要停止传统智能手机研发的手机厂商，要All in AI，目标是打造AI Device产品、重构Flyme系统和建设AI生态。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">对于AI Device（智能设备）的思考，星纪魅族已经明确了两大主要赛道，AI手机和智能眼镜。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">去年9月星纪魅族的AI生态发布会上，星纪魅族还发布了一款定位2000元档的AI手机魅族 Lucky 08 。显然，在经过不断的产品梳理后，如今这一产品线已经不会再会继续更迭了。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在当前智能手机面临激烈存量竞争的背景下，AI手机将带来新一轮行业洗牌已成为共识。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2024年是公认的“AI手机元年”，没有任何一家厂商敢在这场AI竞赛中缺席。在这条赛道上，三星打响了AI手机第一枪，华为、OPPO、荣耀、vivo、星纪魅族等接连发力。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">然而，当前手机行业集中度高整体增长乏力，星纪魅族要想突出重围面临不小的挑战。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IDC中国研究经理郭天翔也指出，年初大家对于“国补”政策寄予厚望，希望可以明显拉动今年中国智能手机市场需求。不过“国补”政策在推行初期虽一度点燃市场热情，但随着时间推移，因补贴力度有限、落地执行存在梗阻等问题，市场拉动效果逐渐式微，远不及预期。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">与此同时，他表示，2025 年智能手机市场还会面临成本持续走高的困境，叠加消费者对经济前景持谨慎态度，消费信心与购买力显著下滑等挑战。在此背景下，1500-2500 元价格区间的性价比产品，成为手机厂商今年竞争与投入的核心战场。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在3月的星纪魅族2025春季媒体沟通会上，星纪魅族首席运营官廖清红也曾提到，星纪魅族要构筑自己的旗舰，有可能不一定那么高的成本，但要把自己的理念讲清楚，打动消费者。特别是魅族大部分人群是年轻人，他们可能有很强的自己的属性选择，就要和父辈选择不一样。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">与此同时，他提到，星纪魅族做Note系列正是其认为应该有一个价位段，既要追求品质，又要AI平权。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“我们有一个数据分析，中国4000以上的价位段有霸主，但从1500到3500的价位段没有霸主，那说明这个阶段的人群在追求自我，这个时候品牌不重要，可能降到第二梯队。所以从这个当中找我们的一个契机。”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在明确产品矩阵后，真正能让星纪魅族在市场上站稳脚跟的，还是其在AI手机上的创新能力。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">星纪魅族副总裁、Flyme AIOS系统软件负责人周详对华尔街见闻表示，随着AI手机市场竞争升级，各大厂商纷纷押注不同技术路线，试图在智能化浪潮中占据先机。从系统级整合到端云协同，再到开放生态，行业已形成多维度的技术竞争格局。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">星纪魅族则选择了一条“多终端全场景AI互联”的路线，核心特点包括： Flyme AIOS操作系统级AI整合、端云协同+开放生态、差异化AI硬件布局（手机+XR+智能汽车）、与吉利集团深度协同。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">率先发布的Note 16系列只是前菜，星纪魅族AI手机今年的压轴产品无疑是将在夏季发布的魅族22系列。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">万志强透露，作为探索更适合AI时代设计形态和交互体验的产品，魅族22，不仅具备魅族前所未有的小屏手感，在影像能力上也将迎来全面提升。除了标准理想形态的 22 之外，还会有更个性化的22，更轻薄的 22，甚至突破传统手机形态的 22。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">从智能手机时代到AI时代，星纪魅族能否重新在手机市场上占据一席之地，还需经受市场的检验。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  印股大涨，特朗普称印度已提出“零关税”，印度“硬气”只持续了两天？ 
Description:  <p>15日周四，特朗普总统宣称印度已提出对美国商品实施&#34;零关税&#34;，消息公布后，印度股市维持涨势，基准股指NIFTY 50指数涨1%。</p>
<p>据媒体报道，特朗普周四在卡塔尔的一场商业领袖活动上表示，<strong>印度政府&#34;向我们提出了一项协议，基本上他们愿意对我们不收取任何关税&#34;。</strong></p>
<p>而仅仅就在<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">两天前</a>，印度曾向世界贸易组织（WTO）提交反击特朗普关税的措施，<strong>计划对部分美国输印商品加征关税。</strong></p>
<p>自今年2月莫迪访问白宫以来，印度成为首批与美国开始贸易谈判的国家之一，双方同意在秋季前完成双边协议的第一阶段。<strong>印度贸易部长预计将于5月17日至20日前往美国与特朗普政府官员进行进一步谈判。</strong></p>
<h2>印度突然&#34;示好&#34;？特朗普爆料&#34;零关税&#34;提议</h2>
<p>特朗普的言论出现在印度威胁对美国实施报复性关税两天之后。</p>
<p>5月13日周二，印度政府向世界贸易组织（WTO）提交正式申诉，计划对部分美国输印商品加征关税，以回应美国对印度钢铝产品征收的长期关税措施。当日印股跌超1%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/4e7be9bc-bfe3-4da5-8656-d370c49a1051.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="583" data-wscnw="786"/></p>
<p>此番表态正值新德里对美国总统宣布印巴停火后的态度日益不满之际。特朗普坚称自己利用贸易作为谈判筹码来促成这一休战，而印度官员否认在与巴基斯坦的军事冲突期间与美国官员的会谈中涉及贸易议题。</p>
<p>据当地媒体报道，印度曾提出将平均关税差价从13%降至4%以下——此举被视为印度试图打破双边谈判僵局的举措。</p>
<p>观察家研究基金会战略研究项目副主任Vivek Mishra表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“我们并不希望双边贸易关税升级，但我们在维护自身的利益。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>在同一活动中，特朗普还透露他与苹果公司首席执行官Tim Cook进行了对话，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">试图劝阻后者扩大在印度的生产</a>。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;印度可以自己照顾自己，他们做得很好。&#34;</p>

Title:  IEA月报：2025年全球石油需求增速将放缓至65万桶/日，供应过剩或将持续 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">国际能源署表示，由于“经济逆风”，全球石油需求增长在2025年一季度强劲增长后，今年剩余时间内将放缓，而供应过剩将持续到2026年。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>周四，国际能源署IEA发布最新月度报告，将今年剩余时间全球石油需求增速，从1月至3月的同比增长99万桶/日降至“低迷”的65万桶/日。此外，由于原油价格下跌，该机构还下调了美国页岩油产量的预期。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IEA将2025年全年平均需求增长预测上调至74万桶/日，较上次报告高出2万桶/日。IEA预计2026年全球供应量平均增长将略高于76万桶/日。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">总部位于巴黎的IEA直言：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">今年前三个月很可能仍将是2025年表现最强劲的季度。全球石油需求增长放缓的迹象可能已经开始显现。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">需求的疲软可能会对石油价格造成进一步打击，上个月石油价格因特朗普发动全球贸易战争以及OPEC+宣布增产计划而短暂跌至四年低点。随着部分贸易担忧的缓解，布伦特原油期货价格已略有回升，接近每桶65美元。然而，考虑到需求放缓与供应过剩的双重打击，油价的长期走势仍然面临严峻挑战。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">双重打击：贸易不确定性与新兴市场疲软</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">IEA警告称：&#34;贸易不确定性的增加预计将对世界经济，进而对石油需求产生负面影响。&#34;这一判断来源于特朗普政府发起的全球贸易战，已经对市场信心造成严重打击。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">更令人担忧的是，新兴经济体，特别是中国和印度的石油交付数据已弱于预期，表明全球最大的两个石油需求增长引擎正在失速。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美国页岩油遭遇寒冬：产量预期大幅下调</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">油价的持续低迷正对生产商造成沉重打击。IEA已连续第二个月下调对美国页岩油行业的预测，包括对2026年产量大幅下调19万桶/日。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>尽管美国生产商正经历困境，全球石油供应增长仍将超过需求增长，形成全球供应过剩局面。根据IEA的预测，2026年第一季度，全球石油库存将增加多达200万桶/日。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">OPEC+增产阴云：供应过剩风险进一步加剧</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">石油输出国组织及其伙伴国(OPEC+)已宣布在5月和6月增产41.1万桶/日——是最初计划产量的三倍，沙特正寻求惩罚那些超出产量限制的成员国。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">虽然IEA的计算假设OPEC+选择在6月后保持集团产量稳定，但沙特方面已经警告可能会有进一步的增产。该联盟将于6月1日通过视频会议审查其计划。如果批准额外增产，将导致库存堆积速度更快，进一步加剧供应过剩问题。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>消息面，</strong>中国人民银行公布的<span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">金融数据</a></span>显示，2025年前四个月社会融资规模增量累计为16.34万亿元，比上年同期多3.61万亿元。结合前值计算可得，4月社融规模增量为1.16万亿元，同比多增1.22万亿元。前四个月人民币贷款增加10.06万亿元，结合前值计算可得，4月新增人民币贷款2800亿元。</p>

Title:  阻碍黄金继续上涨的理由：“美元信用崩溃”叙事被打断 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">5月15日周四，现货黄金日内跌幅达1.5%。截止发稿，报3146.31美元/盎司，已从3500元的高点回落10.1%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wscnph" title="" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/bb1e86c5-04e5-4ee5-b761-ca7df1dee09d.png" alt="" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnsize="" data-wscnh="1078" data-wscnw="1577"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">东吴证券陈梦团队14日发布研报认为，黄金中长期上涨的趋势或许还在，但短期上涨的动能被削弱，交易分歧加大。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">具体而言，支撑黄金上涨的“美元信用崩溃”叙事受到挑战。据<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746912?keyword=%E5%95%86%E5%8A%A1%E9%83%A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">商务部</a>，中美各取消了共计91%的加征关税，暂停实施24%的反制关税。<strong>中美贸易协议的达成、美国财政收入的改善以及美联储降息预期的影响，均可能导致美元走强，从而削弱黄金的吸引力。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，央行购金虽支撑金价，但不足以成为金价持续上涨的唯一理由，黄金市场可能正在经历一轮健康调整，投资者应对短期风险保持警惕。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">“美元信用崩溃”叙事被打断</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">东吴证券表示，自2021年11月以来，黄金累计上涨已超100%，目前经M2调整后的黄金价格已基本触达2011年历史峰值区间。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/5e77f483-b11a-4a69-b5ae-572622a2f149.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="402" data-wscnw="829"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，市场投机情绪降温迹象明显，多项技术指标已发出警示信号：黄金净多头持仓回落，价格乖离度最高已触达11%（接近2011年牛市高峰水平），黄金价格交易波动幅度均已现下降态势。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/8ab290ca-e18c-4377-bcc2-53326917ac2b.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="552" data-wscnw="829"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9f7c73a8-62a2-40e1-a69f-f76ce4e888aa.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="335" data-wscnw="829"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告认为，本轮黄金牛市的逻辑之一——“美元信用崩溃”叙事，正受到挑战。历史上黄金牛市往往是多因素驱动的，而熊市的开始通常与美元转强密切相关。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ccb054c9-9283-4554-85d2-19e531820636.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="463" data-wscnw="829"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">东吴证券回顾两轮典型的黄金见顶回落案例：1980年，美联储为遏制通胀连续大幅加息，紧缩政策提振美元导致金价转跌；2011年，美联储释放退出QE信号，欧债危机暂歇，美元触底反弹引发金价走弱。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f32028ba-7d9c-4966-89bd-604594c43bc7.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="723" data-wscnw="829"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告认为，目前有三个关键因素支持美元将不会持续走弱：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>贸易协议逐步达成</strong>：5月8日英美确定达成首份关税协议；据商务部，5月12日中美发布日内瓦经贸联合声明。贸易不确定性风险减弱将降低对美国经济的干扰。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e8b2d88e-38df-4b47-9444-d4c5b2b722f3.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="458" data-wscnw="709"/></p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e3b0d5d6-078b-4c44-9560-14713dbdc831.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="453" data-wscnw="709"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>美国财政收入改善</strong>：特朗普政府通过关税收入改善财政状况，自4月2日以来，美国关税收入已累计达135亿美元。即便剩余时间仅对全球普遍加征10%关税，还将额外增加近350亿美元。这有望将今年财政赤字率从6.2%降至5.8%。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/2606414c-334b-4002-b912-0972afc7c8c5.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="326" data-wscnw="709"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>美联储降息临近但不一定削弱美元</strong>：尽管美国经济数据依然强劲，但美联储Q2内降息的可能性仍然存在。报告认为，本轮预防式降息并非旨在导致美元走弱，而是为美国经济提供支持，从而增强美元资产的吸引力。因此，降息反而可能促使美元走强，进而削弱黄金的吸引力。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f8f5f3f1-1986-4b00-9f35-eff8db46a1ae.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="305" data-wscnw="709"/></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">央行购金支撑有限，不足以维持牛市延续</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告认为，虽然央行购金是金价上涨的因素之一，但也存在风险。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2008年金融危机后，全球黄金储备持续增长，新兴市场成为购金主力，这是为了进行多元化资产配置，减少美元资产波动带来的影响。然而，历史数据显示，央行购金并未使黄金价格持续上涨或维持不断的牛市。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>此外，国际储备中黄金占比提升也带来风险：</strong>一方面，如果黄金价格下跌，将直接影响外汇储备账面价值；另一方面，央行用外汇购金若没有充分冲销，可能导致货币供应量减少，对通缩环境下的经济产生不利影响。因此，央行购金不足以成为黄金价格持续上涨的决定性因素。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/600a4fe7-4cb7-4562-a12d-9af86f7802d8.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="359" data-wscnw="829"/></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  特朗普施压库克：不希望苹果在印度建厂！ 
Description:  <p>特朗普“威胁”苹果印度制造计划，美印贸易谈判暗流涌动。</p>
<p>周四，媒体报道称，<strong>特朗普透露他已与苹果CEO Tim Cook进行了交谈，明确表示不希望苹果扩大在印度的生产。</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;我对他说，我不希望你们在印度建厂。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>他声称，作为这次谈话的结果，<strong>苹果将&#34;增加他们在美国的生产&#34;。</strong></p>
<p>值得注意的是，苹果在本月的<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746379?keyword=%E8%8B%B9%E6%9E%9C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">财报电话会</a>上曾出乎意料地宣布，计划大部分销往美国的设备将从印度和越南生产，以应对潜在关税压力。</p>
<h2 id="62c3f24">特朗普叫停苹果印度扩张计划</h2>
<p>特朗普的这番言论直接针对苹果公司近年来在全球市场的扩张战略。苹果一直在积极推动其供应链多元化。</p>
<p>苹果<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746372" target="_blank" rel="noopener">第二财季的业绩虽勉强超出预期</a>，但在特朗普关税政策的冲击下，其未来增长前景仍充满不确定性。</p>
<p>在5月1日召开的财报电话会上，Tim Cook宣布，<strong>在即将到来的6月季度，“大多数”销往美国的iPhone将来自印度，而“几乎所有”其他设备（包括iPad、Mac、Apple Watch和AirPods）将来自越南。</strong>这一战略转变意在减轻特朗普政府关税政策对公司的冲击。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“我们很早以前就学到了一课，把所有东西都放在一个地方风险太大。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>此外，库克还表示，苹果正在从美国采购玻璃和Face ID模块，同时从12个州购买190亿块芯片。</p>
<p>他预估，关税将导致公司第三财季(4-6月)将额外增加9亿美元(约合65.4亿元人民币)成本，他暗示未来几个季度这一数字可能会更高。苹果拒绝透露是否会涨价，或者是否把成本转嫁给消费者。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  海湖庄园协议魅影！新台币之后，下一个是韩元？ 
Description:  <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">特朗普政府外汇政策转向冲击亚洲货币市场，韩元可能是下一个大幅走强的主角。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">据追风交易台消息，野村证券在5月14日的报告中表示，目前韩元有升值潜力。根据野村模型，韩元被低估了约 12%，在新兴市场和G10货币中属于 “最被低估” 的之一（仅次于新台币和日元）。若韩国国家养老金（NPS）提高外汇对冲比例，则对韩元的需求将大大上升。投资者应密切关注韩美外汇磋商进展及即将到来的&#34;7月经贸方案&#34;，做好美元/韩元可能迅速下行至1300水平的准备。</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">从贸易战到货币战？</h2>
<p>据<a href="https://www.cnfin.com/hs-lb/detail/20250514/4233163_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">新华财经</a>14日报道，一位韩国政府官员表示，<strong>韩国财政部副部长崔智英于5月5日会见了美国财政部负责国际金融事务的助理部长Robert Kaproth，双方就美元兑韩元市场进行了讨论。</strong>两人是在意大利米兰举行的第58届亚洲开发银行（ADB）年会期间会面的。</p>
<p>这引发了市场猜测，即特朗普政府可能倾向于美元走弱，并将汇率问题作为即将到来的贸易谈判的重要内容。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">野村证券认为，韩美关于汇率讨论的报道进一步支持了韩国央行行长李柱烈此前的言论，即美国对亚洲国家施加了货币升值压力。而韩国财政部长崔相穆已经强调，<strong>韩国将针对贸易问题准备一份 “7月方案”。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">在亚洲范围内，日本财务大臣加藤可能与贝森特会面讨论汇率问题的报道，也提升了市场对亚洲货币升值的预期。尽管加藤可能反驳市场关于美国施压日本让日元升值的言论，但如果有迹象表明汇率是贸易讨论的一部分，亚洲货币升值的风险将呈现不对称性。</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>韩元升值有其基本面因素</strong></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">野村认为，尽管美国施压可能是推动韩元升值的主要因素，基本面方面也存在支持韩元升值的理由。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">野村基本均衡汇率（FEER）、购买力平价（基于 CPI 的 PPP）、实际有效汇率（REER）和经生产率调整的实际有效汇率（REER）模型均显示韩元持续被低估，<strong>整体上韩元被低估了约 12%。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>韩元也是新兴市场和 G10 货币中被低估最严重的货币之一，亚洲地区另外两种被严重低估的货币是新台币和日元。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">与此同时，韩国国家养老金服务（NPS）可能增加外汇对冲。NPS 可轻松将其海外投资的战略外汇对冲比例提升至 10%。<strong>截至2025年2月，其海外投资额为4970亿美元，这意味着可能有497亿美元的潜在外汇出售。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">野村警告，<strong>需要警惕外国投资抛售 / 汇回或外汇对冲的风险。如果韩元大幅升值的预期增强，可能存在其他加强韩元的资金流入来源。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">据野村估计，截至2025年5月9日，韩国散户的海外投资总额为1390亿美元，且已有迹象表明，由于美国例外论褪色和对美元走弱的担忧，他们正在抛售海外资产（主要是股票）。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">另一个风险是，资产管理规模达1.3 万亿美元（截至2024年底，约合180.2万亿韩元）的资管行业，其外国持股约为 1530 亿美元（21.4 万亿韩元），实际资金管理者可能增加外汇对冲（卖出美元），这可能进一步推高韩元。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<h2>新能源业务全面爆发，盈利能力大幅改善</h2>
<p>财报显示，一季度，吉利汽车销量达到70.38万辆，同比增长48%，创下历史新高。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/8d402121-628d-4121-a494-cc6269565ffe.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="181" data-wscnw="650"/></p>
<p>新能源业务表现尤为亮眼，吉利新能源产品（含吉利、领克、极氪）一季度销量达33.9万辆，其中银河品牌销量达到26万辆，同比增长214%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/fcd7a823-d264-4a64-a836-d8b346300e73.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="896" data-wscnw="674"/></p>
<p>根据吉利汽车公告，新能源业务盈利能力全面改善，规模效应开始显现，这是推动整体净利润大幅提升的关键因素之一。</p>
<p>财报还显示，一季度研发费用达33.28亿元，同比增加24.6%，显示其持续加码技术投入。</p>
<h2>极氪表现强势，扭亏为盈成为新增长点</h2>
<p>作为吉利汽车的重要子公司，极氪在一季度交出了一份出色的答卷。据Auto有范儿， 5月15日，极氪科技发布2025年一季度财报。据财报披露：</p>

</blockquote>
<p>这表明极氪有望走出此前的亏损周期，为吉利汽车集团贡献更多利润。</p>
<p>本月早些时候，吉利宣布计划将高端电动汽车品牌极氪私有化，一年前在纽约上市的极氪目前估值约为64亿美元。</p>
<h2>完成领克收购，战略布局更加清晰</h2>
<p>财报显示，吉利汽车在今年二月完成了对领克汽车的控股权收购。</p>
<p>通过此次交易，吉利与沃尔沃共同持有的领克由之前的合营企业转变为吉利汽车的非全资子公司。</p>
<p>收购完成后，极氪通过其子公司浙江极氪持有领克51%股权，而吉利汽车另一附属公司持有49%股权。</p>
<p>这一战略性收购使吉利能够进一步整合资源，增强在豪华和高端市场的竞争力，同时加强与沃尔沃的协同效应。</p>
<h2>面临的挑战：流动负债和未来增长持续性</h2>
<p>尽管业绩亮眼，财报显示吉利汽车仍面临一些挑战。</p>
<p>财报显示，截至3月31日，公司流动负债净值为112.51亿元，这一数字较去年年末的108.18亿元有所增加。</p>

<p>不过，公司董事会认为这不会对持续经营能力产生重大影响，理由是公司业务持续产生稳定现金流、与多家金融机构保持良好关系且有备用融资安排，同时管理层已制定改善流动性的具体计划。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  油价大跌3%！伊朗称愿与美国达成协议 
Description:  <p>市场担忧伊朗可能达成核协议，地缘政治缓和继续推动石油供应前景宽松。周四，国际油价短线走低，WTI原油和布油均跌超3%。</p>
<p>据<a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30821068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">澎湃新闻</a>，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊的一位高级顾问14日向美媒透露，伊朗准备在一定条件下与美国总统特朗普签署核协议，以换取解除经济制裁。据媒体报道，特朗普15日称，<strong>与伊朗达成协议的距离非常接近。</strong></p>
<p>受此消息影响，布伦特原油价格跌破每桶65美元，此前一天已下跌0.8%。西德克萨斯中质原油（WTI）交易价格报60.78美元/桶。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/15dc2053-5126-4fb5-b8a5-63a909a61538.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1070" data-wscnw="1577"/></p>
<p>油价下跌也受到美国原油库存增加的影响。政府数据显示，<strong>美国原油库存增幅创下自3月以来之最，终结了此前连续四天的上涨行情。</strong></p>
<h2>伊朗核协议预期引发油价下跌</h2>
<p>据参考消息援引路透社5月14日报道，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊的顾问阿里·沙姆哈尼在美国全国广播公司14日发布的采访中表示，伊朗愿与美国达成协议，以换取美国解除对伊经济制裁。</p>
<p>今年以来原油价格下跌超过13%。美国生产商表示，预计在年底前油价不会有太大变化。<strong>如果伊朗供应增加，可能会加剧今年晚些时候的潜在供应过剩。</strong></p>
<p>此前，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747100?keyword=OPEC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">石油输出国组织（OPEC）</a>及其盟友上个月开始恢复自2022年以来暂停的供应。根据周三发布的月度报告，该组织4月份仅增加了25000桶/日的产量，远低于此前计划的138000桶/日。该联盟将在6月1日的会议上考虑进一步增产。</p>
<p>Chaos Ternary Futures Co. 旗下研究机构的分析师Zhou Mi表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“原油仍处于中长期下跌趋势，<strong>OPEC+增产和地缘政治缓和继续推动供应前景宽松。</strong>” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>他认为，关税紧张关系缓解可能暂时提振燃料需求，进而提高炼油利润率，从而限制原油的下跌空间。</p>
<p>值得关注的是，<strong>汽油正在显露出强劲迹象。</strong>纽约即期价差（即两个最近到期合约之间的差价）接近五个月来的最高点。这种“现货升水”现象（即近期价格高于远期价格）被视为对需求的利好信号。</p>
<p>国际能源署（IEA）是消费国的重要顾问机构，其发布的供需预测比OPEC的预测更受石油交易者的关注。 <strong>IEA将于周四晚些时候发布最新的供需预估，</strong>市场将密切关注该报告，以研判原油供需的未来走向。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  一周两次上调中国股市目标价！高盛：沪深300还有17%上涨空间 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">贸易缓和带动市场反弹，高盛一周内两次上调中国股市目标价，重回4月2日前预测水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，由于关税谈判情况超预期，截止5月14日，中国股市已完全收复4月2日前的跌幅，MSCI中国、沪深300和恒生科技指数较4月初高点上涨2-4%。</p>
<p>相应地，<strong>高盛维持对中国股票的超配评级，将中国股市12个月目标价调整至4月2日前预测水平，MSCI中国和沪深300指数目标分别为84和4600点，隐含11%和17%的上行空间。</strong>此前，高盛经济学家上调了美国和中国GDP增长预期。</p>
<p>值得一提的是，这是高盛在不到一周内第二次上调指数目标，此前在4月初因相互加征关税曾两次下调目标价。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9e38dd6b-8d89-4c2d-8a75-9c104b6baaee.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="473" data-wscnw="577" data-wscnsize="48130"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">关税降低带动市场回暖，股市收复4月2日来失地</h2>
<p>据<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746912?keyword=%E5%95%86%E5%8A%A1%E9%83%A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">商务部</a>，12日，中美各取消了共计91%的加征关税，暂停实施24%的反制关税。这一降幅超出市场预期，中国股市已完全收复4月2日来13%的跌幅。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高盛表示，截至5月14日收盘，中国股市已完全收复4月2日后的跌幅，中国离岸市场股票和在岸市场分别收复了13%和7%的跌幅。MSCI中国、沪深300和恒生科技指数现在较4月初高点上涨2-4%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">从板块表现看，硬件科技、工业和消费板块领涨，新兴市场出口商和国内受益者主题表现突出。相比之下，医疗保健、美国出口商和政府支出相关标的表现落后。<strong>年初至今，中国离岸市场仍是全球表现最好的股票市场之一，涨幅达17%，而MSCI新兴市场（不含中国）和发达市场指数分别上涨6%和3%。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">经济增长预期上调，股市目标调整4月2日前水平</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">鉴于关税降幅超预期以及过去一个月美国金融环境宽松，高盛经济研究团队做出了几项预测调整：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">美国方面：将2025年增长预期上调0.5个百分点至1%（环比年率），同时将12个月内衰退概率降至35%。美联储降息时间推后，预计将从12月FOMC会议开始，以每隔一次会议25个基点的节奏进行三次降息，而非此前预测的7月开始连续降息。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">中国方面：将2025年和2026年实际GDP增长预期上调，同时货币和财政政策的宽松程度可能略低于此前预期。</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>高盛预计，MSCI中国和沪深300指数在未来12个月分别达到84点和4600点（较此前预测的78点和4400点有所上调），几乎与4月初的预期完全一致，分别存在11%和17%的潜在上涨空间。</strong></p>
<p>高盛认为，互联网与服务行业将受益于消费复苏与数字化转型加速。同时，在政策宽松周期下，优质区域银行与头部房企估值修复可期。在政策刺激受益领域，基建产业链包括建材、工程机械以及新能源汽车等有望巩固发展势头。</p>
<p>围绕结构性增长主题，高盛建议关注精选AI产业链，如算力基础设施（GPU服务器、光模块）、垂直场景应用（智能驾驶、工业软件）等；新兴市场出口商，如拓展东盟、中东市场的制造业龙头；以及股东回报提升主题相关的高股息国企改革标的、股份回购力度加大的消费白马等。</p>

Title:  德鲁肯米勒一季度：减持谷歌、亚马逊、特斯拉，买入台积电和AppLovin 
Description:  <p>华尔街传奇投资者、有“史上最伟大的赚钱机器”之称的斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒（Stanley Druckenmiller）在2025年第一季度的投资组合调整中动作频频。</p>
<p>根据提交给美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的文件，德鲁肯米勒旗下的Duquesne Family Office<strong>在一季度完全清仓了37只股票，减持了包括谷歌、亚马逊和特斯拉在内的多只科技股，还削减了对美国航空公司的押注，</strong>似乎已经平仓了大量与American Airlines Group股票挂钩的看涨期权。</p>
<p>与此同时，<strong>Duquesne在本季度共新增12只股票，包括台积电和AppLovin的股份，</strong>还增持了包括Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd在内的几只医疗股。同时增加了对 Coupang的投资，该公司目前已成为Duquesne的主要持仓之一。</p>
<p>截至2025年第一季度，德鲁肯米勒投资主要集中在9个行业：医疗保健、科技、消费周期性、工业、能源、消费必需品、金融服务、基础材料和通信服务。医疗保健和科技行业占据了投资组合的主导地位。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/09a826c7-a804-485b-aea9-bde151eb8f43.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="632" data-wscnw="870"/></p>
<h2>重仓“新宠”：DocuSign、CCC智能解决方案与EQT公司</h2>
<p><strong>德鲁肯米勒在本季度共新增12只股票</strong>，其中最大的新增持仓是Docusign Inc，购入107.47万股，价值8748万美元，占投资组合的2.86%，表明他看好数字签名和文档管理市场。</p>
<p>第二大新增持仓为CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc，购入559.5万股，价值5052万美元，占投资组合的1.65%。第三大新增持仓是EQT Corp，购入85.93万股，价值4592万美元，占投资组合的1.5%。</p>
<h2>“加码”巨头：Teva和台积电成增持重点</h2>
<p>截止第一季度，德鲁肯米勒最大持仓为Natera Inc（一家基因检测公司），占比15.72%，其他主要持仓包括：Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd占7.47%、Coupang Inc占6.67%、Woodward Inc占6.55%和Philip Morris International Inc占5.73%。</p>
<p>与此同时，德鲁肯米勒大幅增持了台积电的股票，增加了49.13万股，使总持股量达到59.88万股，增幅高达456.93%，总价值9940万美元。</p>
<h2>清仓大戏：37只持仓“灰飞烟灭”</h2>
<p>德鲁肯米勒在本季度完全清仓了37只股票。</p>
<p>最引人注目的撤资包括Skechers USA Inc的全部107.48万股，对投资组合造成1.94%的负面影响；以及SLM Corp的全部252.03万股，对组合产生1.87%的负面影响。</p>
<h2>战略缩减：科技股持仓重大调整</h2>
<p><strong>值得注意的是，德鲁肯米勒在科技领域做出了一系列重大调整，减持了包括谷歌、亚马逊和特斯拉在内的多只科技股。</strong></p>
<p>他还减持了Seagate Technology Holdings PLC134.46万股，这使得该公司在其投资组合中的份额下降了85.97%，影响组合比例3.12%。该股票在本季度的平均交易价格为94.51美元，过去3个月回报率6.74%，今年迄今为25.49%。</p>
<p>另一个显著减持是United Airlines Holdings Inc 67.51万股，减持比例高达64.68%，对投资组合影响1.76%。该航空股在季内平均交易价格为94.43美元，但表现不佳，过去3个月下跌26.59%，今年至今下跌21.17%。</p>
<h2>投资组合总体概览：医疗保健领域占据主导</h2>
<p><strong>截至2025年第一季度，德鲁肯米勒投资主要集中在9个行业：医疗保健、科技、消费周期性、工业、能源、消费必需品、金融服务、基础材料和通信服务。</strong>医疗保健和科技行业占据了投资组合的主导地位。</p>

<p>SEC要求持有超过1亿美元特定证券的机构投资经理，通过季度备案文件（即13-F文件）披露其持仓情况。这些文件虽然受到投资界的广泛关注，但也存在局限性。披露的信息仅反映季度末的投资规模和构成。由于存在一定的滞后性，这些文件可能无法完全反映投资组合的最新情况。另外，某些投资头寸，包括空头头寸和风险投资，并不需要披露。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  美日协议，七月底前没戏？ 
Description:  <p>石破茂政府遭遇严峻挑战。国内选举压力下，日本政府或寻求与美达成一份“更好的”协议，美日或无法在7月参议院选举前达成协议。</p>
<p>根据<a href="https://www.news.cn/world/20250512/356c2ae86b9a4c21a27bf98bb31dc120/c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">新华网报道</a>，日本首相石破茂12日表示，不能接受在不包含汽车领域的情况下与美方达成协议，也不会为了汽车产业而牺牲农业、以扩大进口美国大米作为谈判筹码。希望日美关税谈判能在确保日本国家利益的基础上取得成果。</p>
<p><strong>日美目前已举行两轮关税谈判，日方持续要求美方重新审视关税措施，但美方一直坚持不能在汽车、钢铁等产品上给予日本“特殊待遇”。</strong></p>
<p>作为美国在亚洲的盟友，日本渴望避免与华盛顿的关系恶化，日本首相石破茂最初的首要任务是抢在其他国家之前坐到美国的谈判桌上。</p>
<p>但来自商界领袖和石破茂所在自民党成员的压力迫使他重新考虑，拒绝任何危及汽车行业或威胁国内农民的协议。</p>
<p><strong>汽车是美日贸易争端的“主战场”。2024年汽车占日本对美贸易顺差的81%。</strong>行业分析认为，本财年，美国关税对日本车企营业利润的影响将达到2万亿日元（约合137亿美元），尽管这种影响可以通过提价等措施来抵消。</p>
<p><strong>石破茂目前领导着一个脆弱的执政联盟，他担心一份一边倒的协议将加深执政党自民党的危机。在日本官员们看来，7月底日本参议院选举之前达成协议的可能性不大。</strong></p>
<p>如果贸然妥协，达成对美有利协议，7月份的参议院选举可能会对石破茂政府造成进一步的损害：一份向美国农产品进口敞开闸门的协议，将被日本国内农业游说团体视作“背叛”，进而影响整个自民党的选情。</p>
<p>目前尚不清楚日本对白宫有多大的影响力。东京在安全方面依赖华盛顿，其2024-2025财年对美商品贸易顺差达630亿美元。特朗普政府指责日本故意压低日元汇率，这进一步加剧了谈判的复杂性。</p>
<p>目前日本最有力的提议可能是增加购买美国农产品、扩大美国汽车的市场准入以及投资阿拉斯加液化天然气管道项目。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/pentago.JPG?itok=l4Xdk2ue" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/pentago.JPG?itok=l4Xdk2ue"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="455b7195-6a36-4792-a59b-53f4eda35fcd" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="336" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/pentago.JPG?itok=l4Xdk2ue" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Audits of the DoD’s financial statements, guided by Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) rules based on private-sector Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), assess the DoD’s $850 billion budget using the profit-driven reporting mechanisms of balance sheets and income statements. This approach is suitable for private-sector, profit-seeking businesses like Boeing, IBM, and General Motors, but not for the DoD, a public-sector, taxpayer-funded federal agency whose primary purpose is to defend the homeland, not generate profits. </p>

<p><strong>This mismatch stems from the 1990 <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-566.pdf">Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act</a>,</strong> which, although well-intended, has unfortunately caused Congress and the public to prioritize financial health over military accountability. Rather than seeking auditor opinions, Congress and taxpayers should look for answers to questions like: Did $5 billion buy 55 F-35 jets? Did $18 billion deliver five ships? Did $330 billion in Operations and Maintenance obligations ensure wartime readiness?</p>

<p>The complete inability of GAAP-based financial accounting and reporting to address such questions or explain the causes of ongoing inefficiency and waste, <strong>such as the Navy’s $1.8 billion wasted on cruiser modernization (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106749">2024 GAO audit)</a>, highlights GAAP’s irrelevance for an agency that spends, not earns.</strong></p>

<p>Instead, the DoD should implement a budgetary audit process focusing on the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR), incorporating managerial cost accounting as outlined in the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 4, and utilizing AI-driven forensic analysis through the DoD’s <a href="https://www.ai.mil/Initiatives/Analytic-Tools/#:~:text=Advana,data%2Dbased%20decision%2Dmaking.">Advana data analytics platform</a>.</p>

<p>This transition would better synchronize audits with the DoD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, ensuring that the $850 billion enhances security, not just balances the books.</p>

<h2>The Problem: Scale and Systemic Flaws</h2>

<p>The DoD’s complexity dwarfs private-sector firms. The <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/afr/fy2022/DoD_FY22_Agency_Financial_Report.pdf">FY 2023 DoD Agency Financial Report</a> revealed that the DoD employed 2.1 million service members and 778,000 civilians across 4,600 global sites, managing $851.7 billion in discretionary funds—half of U.S. discretionary spending—and $3.8 trillion in assets, 70% of the government’s total.</p>

<p>Tracking these resources across 4,500 financial systems makes monitoring obligations and matching them to appropriations difficult; <strong>at least 232 are critical for <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-02-29.pdf">internal controls</a> over data entry, transaction processing, and reporting—an auditing nightmare.</strong></p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2022/gao-audit-report-2022.pdf">2022 GAO Audit</a> found discrepancies in 61% of $3.5 trillion in assets, and the <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/afr/fy2022/DoD_FY22_Agency_Financial_Report.pdf">2024 DoD Financial Agency report</a> found 28 material weaknesses, showing weak internal accounting controls, like failing to reconcile Fund Balances with Treasury (FBwT)—akin to a checkbook not matching a bank statement.</p>

<p>Issues include outdated systems, manual data entry, and training gaps. A  <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/820/817960.pdf">2023 GAO report </a>noted that 18 out of 22 financial systems faced workforce shortages, hindering modernization. Further, multi-year programs like aircraft development blur committed versus available funds, complicating audits. The result? Seven years of disclaimers, with headlines claiming the DoD “can’t pass an audit” and wastes taxpayer money.</p>

<p><strong>But is the DoD truly failing its fiduciary responsibility, or is it trapped in a flawed GAAP-based process irrelevant to its purpose?</strong> Cultural and political pressures, like Congress’s demand for “clean audits” to signal fiscal responsibility, perpetuate this misalignment, distracting from the real question: Are funds delivering security?</p>

<h2>Why GAAP and FASAB Fail the DoD</h2>

<p>GAAP, and by extension FASAB, measures profitability and equity for revenue-generating businesses. Boeing’s $66 billion revenue and $13 billion loss fit this model, but the DoD’s $850 billion budget is all outflows—$5 billion for F-35s, $145 billion for R&D, $330 billion for operations and maintenance, with no income to tally.</p>

<p><strong>FASAB’s directed balance sheets show $3.5 trillion in assets and a “net cost” of $821 billion spent in FY2022, mimicking GAAP’s business-focused standards.</strong> However, 37% of unverifiable assets, according to a <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2022/gao-audit-report-2022.pdf">GAO Independent Auditor report</a>, aren’t a “loss” but record-keeping issues. In particular, material weaknesses contributing to $2.4 trillion or 61% in <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3219566/dod-makes-audit-progress-but-much-more-needs-to-happen-official-says/">untracked assets</a> and $14 billion in “missing” parts, flagging “ bookkeeping “control gaps, not “mission” gaps. </p>

<p>Former Navy Comptroller Russ Rumbaugh made this point in a recent <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/08/navy-comptroller-erp-software-will-finally-enable-a-clean-audit-big-data-analytics/">interview:</a>  <em>“DoD is very accountable, it’s just not auditable,” </em>Rumbaugh told the conference. <em>“We know where the things that go ‘boom’ are, we know where the dollars get spent, [but] to answer those questions [to the satisfaction of auditors], we have to go ask a bunch of stove-piped systems.”</em></p>

<p>The DoD’s <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/federal/federal-permitting/department-defense-dod#:~:text=DOD%20is%20the%20United%20States,at%20over%204%2C790%20sites%20worldwide.">4,800 sites</a> and <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2025/FY2025_Weapons.pdf#:~:text=The%20FY%202025%20President's%20Budget%20request%20for,Navy%2C%20and%2018%20with%20the%20Air%20Force.">2,000+ budget line items</a> for RDT&E and Procurement alone defy GAAP’s clean ledgers, asking “Is it financially healthy?” when the real question is, “What did the taxpayer get?”</p>

<h2>A Better Approach: Managerial Cost Accounting</h2>

<p>A budgetary review process using managerial cost accounting organizes financial data to help DoD leaders allocate resources efficiently—a cost-benefit approach, not a balance sheet. In a <a href="https://christopherhanks.substack.com/p/a-proposal-to-emphasize-managerial">published paper</a>, <em>A Proposal to Emphasize Managerial Cost  Accounting in the Department of Defense</em>, <a href="https://www.dau.edu/sites/default/files/2024-07/No.%202%20Issue%2051.pdf">Dr. Christopher Hanks</a>, a former RAND analyst, argues that the DoD has neglected this tool, which is “unappreciated and underused.”</p>

<p>He argues that<strong> the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 4 (<a href="https://files.fasab.gov/pdffiles/handbook_sffas_4.pdf">SFFAS 4</a>) mandated by Congress tracks costs to outputs and is a better approach to evaluating the DoD budget, </strong>ensuring funds align with goals. For example, $82 billion in aid for Ukraine can be traced to emergency laws and evaluated for outcomes.</p>

<p>Unlike GAAP, this approach monitors obligations (commitments), <strong>ensuring compliance with appropriations and justifying variances, not chasing asset-liability matches</strong>. Instead, it should assess how budget approvals are documented. Are controls preventing overspending? Are goods being produced efficiently and providing the intended capabilities? This shift better aligns with Congress’s mandate to spend effectively, not mimic private-sector accounting.</p>

<h2>Aligning Managerial Cost Accounting to DoD’s Budget Process</h2>

<p>The DoD uses a detailed, although cumbersome, process to develop its annual budget. It goes through several steps: aligning the president’s and defense secretary’s security strategy through planning, developing proposed funding for programs that support it, converting those programs into budget requests, and executing it, or what is referred to as the <a href="https://www.dau.edu/acquipedia-article/planning-programming-budgeting-execution-process-ppbe">Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE)</a> process.</p>

<p><strong>This process was first introduced in the 1960s by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara,</strong> who brought this business-like budgeting process from Ford Motor Company to the DoD. It has undergone several adjustments and improvements, creating an arduous but, for the most part, effective method. However, it routinely receives scrutiny and is the subject of recent reform and questionable overhaul requests.</p>

<p>For instance, the recent congressionally directed <a href="https://ppbereform.senate.gov/finalreport/">PPBE Reform Commission</a> has called for stronger, more responsive connections between strategy and spending within the PPBE process. However, the commission's primary goal is to offer recommendations for the PPBE process that meet Congress’s demand for a “clean audit opinion.”</p>

<p>While the commission made several strong recommendations to enhance the PPBE process,<strong> it neglected to tackle the elephant in the room: the way the DoD conducts audits.</strong> Instead, it reinforced a business-oriented audit approach, focusing on better managing financial statements rather than recognizing that imitating them is the issue.</p>

<p>Integrating SFFAS 4 into PPBE is a better reform solution – tracking obligations to capabilities (e.g., $145 billion in R&D for 10 hypersonic missiles) and ensuring that funds deliver results. Changing the term “<em>costs</em>” to “<em>obligations</em>” (both measured in dollars) allows SFFAS 4 to more effectively support PPBE reform by addressing the question, “Does $850 billion of approved obligation authority in the DoD’s budget, executed as planned, fulfill the president’s security strategy?”</p>

<h2>AI-Driven Forensic Approach for Execution</h2>

<p>One of the primary challenges in achieving a clean audit is reconciling how the DoD distributes funds. Thousands of systems, hundreds of checkbooks, and various financial systems create an almost insurmountable bookkeeping task.</p>

<p><strong>Until recently, manual efforts by thousands of auditors—costing $4 billion in audit remediation since 2018—were necessary to examine DoD finances </strong>as if the DoD were a business struggling to reconcile billions in obligations and payments due to chaotic financial systems, poor bookkeeping, and internal control challenges—essentially trying to fit a square peg (accounting) into a round hole (accountability).</p>

<p>With the advent of AI and a more forensic accounting approach to execution, it has become possible to scour the DoD’s 4,500 financial systems to trace obligations, detect fraud and waste, and confirm legal transactions. Using the Advana platform, <strong>AI-driven forensic accounting can trace questionable spending</strong>, such as <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Aug/12/2003521744/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2024-114.PDF">the DoD Inspector General’s 2023 report</a> that found “47 (or 80 percent) of the 59 contracts reviewed, DoD contracting officers did not obtain sufficient documentation to support their positive determination of financial responsibility…”</p>

<h2>What needs to change</h2>

<p>Is a traditional business audit suitable for the DoD, which does not generate revenue but relies on an annual influx of capital? Like most federal government agencies, the DoD depends on approved budgets from Congress to continue existing and operating. Like all businesses, it does not rely on sales to customers and profits for investors to assess its financial health.</p>

<p>What needs to change is a more practical approach to assessing the budget, one that seeks accountability in the utilization of capital rather than a strict audit of expenditures. Did the obligations effectively support the mission and achieve the intended outcomes? Were the obligations used efficiently, effectively, and correctly accounted for?</p>

<p>Furthermore, <strong>can the organization monitor every dollar of its commitments to ensure alignment with strategic objectives and compliance with legal requirements?</strong> Can internal controls effectively reduce fraud, waste, or abuse, and can this assessment inform next year's budget request by considering anticipated challenges and new initiatives?</p>

<p>This approach to the DoD audit situation is not merely a cultural shift; it signifies a new method for assessing how efficiently and effectively taxpayer funds are utilized by the DoD and how they support future funding needs.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ul><li>SFFAS 4 for PPB tracks costs to capabilities: The $44 billion for F-35s allocates $30 billion to aircraft, $10 billion to spares, and $4 billion to training, aligning with national defense goals. It measures unit costs (e.g., cost per jet) and ensures funds are cost-effective and provide the intended capability.</li>
	<li>AI Forensics for Execution: AI using Advana analytics verifies obligations traced to laws, enhancing accountability—did $5 billion produce 55 F-35s? It flags waste, like $80 million in misallocated funds, by analyzing hundreds of DoD “checkbooks” across systems. A well-funded AI pilot could recover billions and trace them to obligations.</li>
	<li>Restoring Advana’s Role:  Advana, mandated by the 2018 NDAA, has drifted into logistics and readiness but should refocus on its initially intended “audit” role. Additional funding could integrate SFFAS 4 and AI, streamlining financial tracking and quickly paying for itself within a few years.</li>
</ul><h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul><li>Amend the 1990 CFO Act by limiting the requirement for financial-statement audits at the DoD to the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) alone.  Clean auditor opinions on SBRs will reflect, among other things, solutions to reconciling DoD’s checkbook problems and ensure that intended deliverables (e.g., $4 billion = ships) are tied to appropriations.</li>
	<li>Revise the FASAB mandate to prioritize SFFAS 4 managerial obligation accounting to support budgeting and AI forensics for execution, replacing GAAP/FASAB’s financial focus with a more accountable approach to DoD’s budget.</li>
	<li>Mandate SFFAS 4 in PPBE: The FY2026 NDAA should lock SFFAS 4 into budgeting, splitting $145 billion R&D into traceable costs (e.g., 10 hypersonic missiles that produce intended capability), not vague assets.</li>
	<li>nbsp;       Fund AI Forensics: Launch a DoD Inspector General AI pilot, testing, for example, $50 billion in procurement. Scale it to $850 billion, flagging obligations like “F-35 spares and parts to meet future operations and maintenance requirements.”</li>
	<li>Reintegrate Advana: Refocus Advana on audit readiness with proper funding, incorporating SFFAS 4 and AI to trace funds. Train financial staff and associate managers to support implementation.</li>
</ul><h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The DoD’s audit failures stem from applying GAAP’s profit lens to a spender’s mission. Seven disclaimers, over $1 trillion in asset discrepancies, and 28 weaknesses prove FASAB’s flaws. SFFAS 4 and AI forensics offer a fix: $18 billion = 5 ships, $5 billion = 55 F-35s, traceable to law, not ledgers.</p>

<p>Amending the CFO Act, mandating SFFAS 4, and funding AI and Advana will deliver accountability. Despite challenges like training and resistance, a phased approach ensures feasibility. Congress and taxpayers deserve answers to “What’d we get?” not “Where’s the receipt?” This shift makes $850 billion count.</p>
