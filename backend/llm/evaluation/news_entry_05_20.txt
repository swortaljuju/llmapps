<p>"I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones," said the 67-year-old Adams during his May 19 "Coffee with Scott Adams" show on Rumble.</p>

<p>"My life expectancy is maybe this summer. I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer."</p>

<p>Adams said that the cancer "is already intolerable."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that I don’t have good days. So if you are wondering, ‘Hey Scott, do you have any good days’? Nope. Nope. Every day is a nightmare and evening is even worse."</p>

<p>"<strong>I do have the ability to kind of get up for this part of the day, but I am in pain, and I’m always in pain</strong>. And the pain moves around to different parts of my body,” he said during the show. “I’ve been using a walker to walk for months now."</p>

However, he did mention that<strong> he attempted to use medications such as ivermectin and fenbendazole to no effect.</strong></p>

<p>Adams had words of support for Biden and his family.</p>

<p>“I’d like to extend my respect and compassion and sympathy for the ex-president and his family, because <strong>they’re going to be going through an especially tough time</strong>,” he said.</p>

<div class="my-5">On Sunday, a Biden spokesperson confirmed that an aggressive form of prostate cancer had spread to the former president’s bones, meaning that it has metastasized. The American Cancer Society <a class="article-hover-class" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank">says</a> that when a cancer metastasizes, the survival rate drops significantly.</div>

<p>“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,” Biden’s office told media outlets. “<strong>The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</strong>”</p>

<p>In a post on X on Monday morning, Biden included a photo of himself and his wife Jill Biden, and wrote: “Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.”</p>

<p>Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what’s known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9, and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.</p>

<p><strong>A number of political leaders on both sides of the political aisle sent words of support to Biden after the announcement.</strong></p>

<p>Trump, a longtime political opponent, wrote on social media that he was saddened by the news and “we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”</p>

<p>Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, said on social media that she was keeping him in her family’s “hearts and prayers during this time.”</p>

<p>Adams launched “Dilbert” in 1989. Known for its satirical office humor, the comic at one point appeared in thousands of newspapers across multiple languages.</p>

<p>In 2023, the strip was dropped by many publications after Adams made controversial comments on race.</p>

Title: The 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Will "Massively" Increase Near-Term Deficits, Add $5 Trillilon In Debt
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Will "Massively" Increase Near-Term Deficits, Add $5 Trillilon In Debt</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Late last week, the <em><strong>Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) </strong></em>released its preliminary score of the House Ways and Means Committee mark-up of the large budget reconciliation bill working its way through Congress, also known as Trump's "<strong><em>Big, Beautiful Bill</em></strong>" (<em><strong>BBB</strong></em>). And while the BBB is inching to passing through Congress - despite holdouts still remaining <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/im-still-no-battle-over-salt-holding-big-beautiful-bill-trump-demands-progress">especially over the size of the SALT deduction </a>- here is a snapshot of what is in the Bill, and how it will affect the US in the coming decade.</p>

<p>We start with a look at the fiscal policy focus of the BBB: Republicans' slim majority and their use of the budget reconciliation process are key influences on the composition of the fiscal policy-related legislation. That said, <strong>extending the expiring provisions of the TCJA should have sufficient support </strong>within the party for enactment. Additional tax cuts, such as a domestic manufacturing credit and not taxing tips, will be facilitated by the political viability of sufficient “pay-fors”. This will likely include watered-down versions of proposed IRA tax credit phase-outs and cuts to social spending programs.</p>

<p>So how does one quantify the impact of the BBB: as a reminder, the <strong><em>Ways and Means Committee </em></strong>is responsible for writing the main tax code portion of the bill. Relative to the CBO’s January 2025 baseline, the JCT estimated the mark up to <strong>increase deficits by $3.8trn over the next 10 years, </strong>with most of the deficit increase ($2.2trn) occurring over the next five years. Indeed, breaking the bill down even further, of the $1.9trn of total savings identified in the mark up, the majority ($1.2trn) is realized over the back half of the 10-year budget window.</p>

<p>It is also notable that <strong>$915bn of savings stem from capping individual deductions for state and local taxes </strong>– a figure that will come down in the final legislation given the pushback from many Republicans in high tax states. As a reminder, under current law, <strong>upon expiry of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the cap on state on local deductions would go away leading to lower tax revenues </strong>(all else equal).</p>

<p>In addition, <strong>~$560bn of savings are generated through terminations or earlier phasing out of clean energy-related tax credits and another $116bn from “remedies against unfair foreign taxes”</strong> – both measures highly dependent on projections with very wide error bands and/or yet to be defined enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<p>As DB's Brett Ryan - who previously had made his own deficit claculations as a result of the "Big, Beautiful Bill"- writes, while the specific components of the additional tax cuts on top of the TCJA extension differed from what he had previously outlined, the JCT score of the Ways and Means mark-up was largely in line with the top-line deficit assumptions provided by Deutsche Bank. However, one key difference was 2025, where Ryan had assumed more of the additional tax cuts on top of the TCJA extension would be made retroactive to 2025. The first table below shows DB's prior estimates for deficit increases from tax and spending measures – excluding tariff revenue assumptions – compared to the latest JCT score of the Ways and Means mark up.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/ways%20and%20means.jpg?itok=ifIeJqtR" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ways%20and%20means.jpg?itok=ifIeJqtR"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e00b32f6-6a28-4978-8566-55f633426300" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="219" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ways%20and%20means.jpg?itok=ifIeJqtR" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>To be sure, the JCT scoring of the Ways and Means Committee mark-up does not capture key elements of the fiscal outlook – namely, <strong>estimates of tariff revenues and potential spending increases. </strong>Recall that the Ways and Means Committee is responsible for the tax writing portion of the bill and JCT only scores revenue-related measures. Indeed, CBO scoring will likely provide a more complete picture on tariff revenue and spending as the legislative process moves forward. DB anticipates $300bn of increased spending on border and defense to be front loaded over the next couple of years as well as tariff revenues of around ~250bn per year.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/JCT%20score%201.jpg?itok=U2GpuZjN" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/JCT%20score%201.jpg?itok=U2GpuZjN"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="092cdc85-1305-425b-b95d-56cc3ba76c9a" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="184" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/JCT%20score%201.jpg?itok=U2GpuZjN" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Risks are two-sided at this point. On the one hand, tariff revenues could be higher than currently penciled in, which assumes a ~15% tariff rate and only 2% import growth on average going forward. Conversely, the JCT score of the Ways and Means mark-up can be best thought of as a floor in terms of deficit increases over the 10-year budget window. The final legislative product is likely to show even less savings once the House and Senate “reconcile” their differences. </p>

<p>In short, as DB concludes, "<strong>there appears to be no serious effort at reining in historically-elevated deficits which remain on track to exceed over 6% of GDP in the coming years."</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/us%20deficit.jpg?itok=JyVUexAd" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/us%20deficit.jpg?itok=JyVUexAd"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="18c8d6cc-da53-4576-b8fd-1551730b11a0" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="313" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/us%20deficit.jpg?itok=JyVUexAd" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Extending on this, Morgan Stanley writes that the bank's base case is that a politically viable fiscal package will be composed of tax cut extensions with incremental tax cuts mostly offset by <em><strong>“pay-fors”. </strong></em>As such, the key driver of projected deficit expansion in 2026 is slowing economic growth and cost growth embedded in current policy, and this fiscal package would add modestly to that baseline. Accounting for potential tariff revenue as a mitigant, the bank expects a 2026 deficit of 7.1% of GDP (vs. 6.7% in 2025), an increase of ~$310 billion year on year...</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2026%20budget%20deficit.jpg?itok=42ow3gSL" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2026%20budget%20deficit.jpg?itok=42ow3gSL"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0a77161c-954b-4e60-aa33-fc0531b7516a" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="277" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2026%20budget%20deficit.jpg?itok=42ow3gSL" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>... however, the bank also lays out a low and high deficit case, where the former leads to a $400BN increase in the deficit, while the latter "only" $200BN.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the bigger picture, keep in mind that the bulk of the BBB is just extending on the tax cuts from Trump 1.0, which is why if the bill does not pass, it would be equivalent to a huge tax hike, one which would lead to a lower budget deficit, but lead to an immediate recession as it would translate into a massive fiscal headwind. As such, while the BBB does lead to higher deficits, if largely due to secondary drivers such as the record $1.2 trillion in gross interest expense and economic slowdown, the <em><strong>Big Beautiful Bill </strong></em>will not result in much policy stimulus in 2026. Meanwhile, as Morgan Stanley notes, <strong>even assuming continuation of current policy, deficits should increase as the economy slows. </strong>And speaking of growth slowing down, MS expects this to happen due to a rise in uncertainty, trade policy, and restrictive immigration, but really it is a modest normalization of the runaway spending of the last two years of the Biden admin. In any case, softer economic growth means lower revenues and a higher deficit. In fact, <strong>only a third of the deficit increase for 2026 is due to discretionary fiscal policy in excess of TCJA extension.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/higher%20deficit%20but%20not%20much%20policy%20stimulus.jpg?itok=tR3oB2Ux" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/higher%20deficit%20but%20not%20much%20policy%20stimulus.jpg?itok=tR3oB2Ux"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a0eab03c-1982-43b5-ad9b-da4ac4a6b10b" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="272" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/higher%20deficit%20but%20not%20much%20policy%20stimulus.jpg?itok=tR3oB2Ux" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Finally, we look at the latest in-depth analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which estimates the <em><strong>BBB </strong></em>would <strong>add $3.3 trillion to the debt including interest or $5.2 trillion if its temporary provisions are made permanent</strong>. In part because new borrowing is front-loaded and offsets are back-loaded, the bill would add massively to near-term deficits.</p>

<p>Unlike Morgan Stanley, the CRFB estimates the House bill would boost the FY 2027 deficit – the deficit in the first year the policies would be fully in effect – substantially more, <strong>by nearly $600 billion</strong>, or 1.8% of GDP. That’s the net effect of roughly $770 billion of new borrowing and only $180 billion of offsets.</p>

<p>The deficits boost represents a one-third increase in total projected deficits from $1.7 to $2.3 trillion – <strong>and a near doubling of the primary (non-interest) deficit. </strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/CRFB%201.jpg?itok=V35Am4dO" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/CRFB%201.jpg?itok=V35Am4dO"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="04a994e2-3652-42a9-b1d2-5826dd0a254a" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="375" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/CRFB%201.jpg?itok=V35Am4dO" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>What is (perhaps not so) unique about the bill is that <strong>spending and tax cuts are front-loaded, </strong>while <strong>offsets are back-loaded, </strong>which means about 55% of the gross deficit increases – $2.8 trillion – would take place in the first half of the budget window. Meanwhile only 40% of the offsets – $970 billion – would accumulate over that period. As a result, <strong>70% </strong>of the non-interest borrowing would occur in the first five years.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/front%20loaded%20spending.jpg?itok=tGy7sl0Y" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/front%20loaded%20spending.jpg?itok=tGy7sl0Y"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fd1a385e-8340-4e7a-be7d-128b3485c9fa" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="375" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/front%20loaded%20spending.jpg?itok=tGy7sl0Y" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The tax cut and spending increase provisions are front-loaded due to the use of “<a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/playing-budget-rules-understanding-and-preventing-budget-gimmicks#gimmick10">arbitrary expirations”</a> designed to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d543f109-1f88-4f4f-9381-6466c6186311" href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/permanent-ways-means-bill-could-add-53-trillion-deficits" title="Permanent Ways & Means Bill Could Add $5.3 Trillion to Deficits">limit reported costs</a>. A number of provisions – including the enhanced Child Tax Credit and standard deduction, no tax on tips and overtime, 100 percent bonus depreciation for equipment, and new ‘MAGA accounts’ – are scheduled to expire in 2028 or 2029. The bill also relies on one-time appropriations for defense and immigration, which must be obligated by 2029. And finally, the bill includes a large number of retroactive provisions that provide a one-time windfall for activities already undertaken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>many of the offsets don’t begin or ramp up until late in the budget window. </strong>Medicaid work requirements, for example, save $300 billion through 2034 but do not take effect until 2028. In addition, while some of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy credits are repealed at the end of 2025, the most expensive ones only begin phasing out in a few years with some restrictions taking effect sooner.<strong> </strong>And the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) state matching fund requirements do not start until 2028. </p>

<p>As a result of this mismatch and the sheer size of the bill’s deficit increases, the House bill would add to the deficit in every single year – with the possible exception of 2025 – even after the temporary provisions expire. <strong>But the largest deficit increases will take place very early in the budget window. </strong></p>

<p>The impact of tariffs aside, this additional acceleration in near-term borrowing could stoke inflation and push up interest rates well above current levels. And it may continue in the future if Congress extends expiring provisions and perhaps cancel some of the offsets.</p>

<p>But what is most amazing, is that even this massive increase in the US deficit in the coming years is <strong>still a remarkable slowdown to the debt and deficit avalanche observed during the Biden administration, </strong>where like the president himself the economy was kept on life support thanks to a cocktail of <em><u><strong>debt, debt and more debt</strong></u></em>, as we <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/here-1-trillion-stealth-stimulus-behind-bidenomics">first explained in the summer of 2023</a>.</p>

<p>This is how Bank of America's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b8uy29f3wb4k8xvtz2gxo/BofA-Hartnett-The-Flow-Show-More-Jaw-Jaw-less-War-War-20250516.pdf?rlkey=epcv8zpugp76d7j8ip36ookkr&dl=0">Michael Hartnett explained </a>the "policy math" as one where <em>monetary and fiscal policy stimulus in 2024 was best in USA, but in 2025 it’s better in the Rest-of-World:</em></p>

<ul><li><strong>US Fed funds rate: </strong>2024 = down 100bps, 2025 = unchanged.</li>
	<li><strong>US government spending: </strong>past 12 months spending up huge $750bn (to $7.1tn), <strong>next 12 months spend down $50bn according to FY26 budget proposal.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>US tariffs: </strong>past 12 months import duties raised $85bn, next 12 months = $400-600bn (assuming 10-15% tariff rate), <strong>tariff taxation that falls on either foreign exporters, domestic importers, or domestic consumers.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>US tax cuts: </strong>next 12 months potentially start delivering $90bn per year in new tax cuts (rather than tax cut extensions); per CRFB current cost of “big, beautiful bill” next 10 years sees $0.2tn TCJA expansion of tax cuts + $0.7tn new tax cuts.</li>
	<li><strong>US policy stimulus crudely flipping from meaty 100bps cuts & $750bn fiscal stimulus to >$250bn fiscal contraction </strong>(spending cuts & tariff hikes before tax cuts) & zero rate cuts…big reason why US economy slows in 2025</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, <strong>China is in big fiscal stimulus mood, and NATO military expenditures: </strong>defense spending in Europe set to rise $100bn per annum; per US proposal all other 31 NATO countries to raise military spend to 5% of GDP by 2032= $700bn extra defense spending by NATO ex. US (currently US accounts for $0.9tn or 69% of the NATO military budget covering 32 members</li>
</ul><p>The final straw, of course, was last Friday's Moody's downgrade of the US Aaa rating - the final one - which took place on purpose just as the debate over the BBB hit a fever pitch. And speaking of Moody's, <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hell-pay-what-americas-debt-doomsday-looks">earlier today we explained </a>that the rating agency assumes the 2017 tax cuts are extended (unlike the last CBO semi-annual estimates), pushing debt and deficits much higher. The key Moody’s projections are:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Interest + mandatory spending will hit 78% of total federal outlays by 2035 </strong>(from 73% in 2024)</li>
	<li>Deficits will rise from 6.4% to <strong>9% of GDP by 2035</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Debt/GDP will hit 134% by 2035 (vs. 98% today)</strong></li>
</ul><p>And, as we also discussed earlier today in what America's Debt Doomsday looks like, both U.S. debt and deficits are about to truly take off. As shown in the chart below, while the baseline CBO projections don’t include the tax cut extension, one of their alternative scenarios of including it <strong>pushes debt/GDP above 200% of GDP over the decades ahead. </strong>The chart hardly needs any further commentary.</p>

<p>For anyone "shocked" by this development, don't be: back in February we warned readers, while praising the efforts of Elon Musk and DOGE, that while superficially cutting and streamlining government spending here and there will help, <strong>it will do nothing at all in the grand scheme of things to truly slash unsustainable government spending</strong>, which is dictated by Congress...</p>

Title: Watch: Inside The Secret Illegal Antifa Headquarters
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Watch: Inside The Secret Illegal Antifa Headquarters</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>From Portland to Washington, D.C., and across Europe, the far-left extremist movement known as Antifa has unleashed years of orchestrated chaos driven by a radical, anti-capitalist agenda aimed at destabilizing the West. Now, for the first time, explosive undercover footage reveals life inside an illegal Antifa headquarters. </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK4M2UOnN1M">YouTuber The Urban Legend</a></em> has released 30 minutes of explosive footage captured inside a secret and illegal Antifa headquarters in Manchester, United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-19_14-42-36.png?itok=TNVwg2Pp" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-19_14-42-36.png?itok=TNVwg2Pp"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="df37bb13-5678-4946-9cad-5650d315526b" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="284" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-19_14-42-36.png?itok=TNVwg2Pp" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The video reveals what appears to be a fully operational base—complete with stockpiles of food, racks of clothing, a sleeping area, and what looks like a makeshift revolutionary workshop for rioters. The footage offers a rare and disturbing glimpse into the behind-the-scenes of the revolutionary movement that has fueled unrest across the West. </p>

<p>We grabbed a series of screenshots from the video, including text on the wall that said: "Give Trans Girls Guns." </p>

<p>Additional graffiti included slogans like "Protect Trans Kids" and "Punch Nazis"—language that, while politically charged, raises serious concerns due to its potential to incite violence. </p>

<p>What appears to be a revolutionary workshop. </p>

<p>Our takeaway: Antifa's HQ in Manchester appears more like a bunch of children who failed to grow up playing fort in a condemned warehouse. Not a drop of testosterone was detected in the entire 30 minutes of footage.</p>

<p><strong>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Megyn Kelly that one reason Dr. Anthony Fauci sought a preemptive pardon before Joe Biden left the White House is because he lied under oath about helping fund the Covid-19 pandemic.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_13-22-18.jpg?itok=nzXylTlJ" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_13-22-18.jpg?itok=nzXylTlJ"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="178ac2ba-6149-469d-99b8-c8af289c8d95" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-20_13-22-18.jpg?itok=nzXylTlJ" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Gabbard recounted the numerous times that Fauci denied providing funding for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) while being questioned under oath by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).</p>

<p><em><strong>“So is it any wonder that he sought a preemptive pardon for anything during a certain period of time by President Biden before he left office,”</strong></em> Gabbard asked.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In the five years since the pandemic first began, the official story that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in a Wuhan wet market has been gradually walked back by members of the media, the intelligence community and the government.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.megynkelly.com/2025/03/17/megyn-kelly-slams-new-york-times-for-column-about-covid-lab-leak-theory/">most likely origin of the virus</a>, according to Kelly, is from a lab leak at the WIV where research was being performed on bat coronaviruses.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China <a href="http://english.scio.gov.cn/whitepapers/2025-04/30/content_117854036_3.html">released a white paper</a> claiming that the U.S. was trying to “shift the blame” for the virus to China, even as Chinese officials accused the U.S. of potentially being the origin point of the virus.</p>

<p>Gabbard said she has not yet read the white paper but maintains that the postmortem on the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over.</p>

<p>Gabbard explained,<em><strong> “I created… the Directors Initiative Group that is focused on investigating a number of the president’s top priorities and the things that the American people really deserve and want to know the truth about. The origins of COVID-19 is one of them… [and] a lot of the work that has been done is on covid.gov.”</strong></em></p>

<p>Gabbard has also teamed up with Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Jay Bhattacharya to find the specific link between gain-of-function research being done by the Wuhan Lab and its partnership with U.S. nonprofit Ecohealth Alliance.</p>

<p><strong>If that link can be established, it would directly link Fauci, through Ecohealth Alliance, to funding the research that gave us Covid-19.</strong></p>

<p>This could open up new possibilities of criminal prosecution of Fauci at the state level as well as the possibility of Biden’s autopen-signed pardon being revoked.</p>

<p>While Republicans hash out the details on the path to passing President Trump's 1,116-page 'Big, Beautiful Bill' - <strong>a key sticking point has emerged in regards to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, </strong>which allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct state and local taxes (such as income and property taxes) from their federal taxable income. <strong>This primarily benefits rich taxpayers in high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey. </strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/trump_098e78_jpg_92.jpg?itok=-tattu1D" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/trump_098e78_jpg_92.jpg?itok=-tattu1D"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ca9451f7-f9b3-48d1-a369-f579c785a874" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/trump_098e78_jpg_92.jpg?itok=-tattu1D" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Tax writers on the House Ways and Means Committee have offered to raise the cap from its current $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making up to $400,000 per year - while Speaker Mike Johnson's most recent offer was a $40,000 cap for indivuduals / $80,000 for couples for four years at a $751,600 income limit.</p>

<p>The 'SALT Caucus,' meanwhile, are holding out for at least a $62,000 cap for individual filers, and $120,000 for couples before they'll vote 'yes' on the bill.</p>

<p>"I’m still a no on the Jason Smith number," said SALT Caucus member Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY), referring to the $30,000 cap floated by House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-MO). "I hope that the president’s presence here today motivates everybody, especially my leadership, to give the SALT Caucus a number to which we could actually say yes."</p>

<p>The SALT cap is worth thousands of dollars in savings to millions of typically higher-income taxpayers who itemize vs. take the standard deduction. <strong>The cost to the rest of America for this would be around $1 trillion over the next decade, </strong>according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>

<p>Before 2017, the average SALT deduction was approximately $13,000, before it was capped at $10,000. In 2022, nearly 10% of all taxpayers used a SALT deduction.</p>

<p><strong>Trump Drops F-Bomb</strong></p>

<p>During a Tuesday meeting with House Republicans, President Donald Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the bill and get it done - asking moderate Republicans from blue states to give up their SALT battle, while warning members <strong>not to "fuck with Medicaid,"</strong> which some lawmakers have eyed for cuts.</p>

<p>"It’s not a question of holdouts. We have a tremendously unified party," Trump told reporters before the meeting. "There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don’t like or that they’re not going to get."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A White House official said <strong>Trump made clear in the meeting that he’s losing patience with all holdout factions of the conference, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus</strong>, and he insisted every Republican should vote “yes.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>His main requests to the conference were not to let SALT impede the bill, a</strong>rguing Republicans can fight for SALT later on; not to touch Medicaid except for eliminating waste, fraud and abuse such as booting off those who entered the country illegally and instituting commonsense work requirements; and to stick together and get the bill done, a White House official told The Hill.</em></p>

<p><em>The president told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting to “let SALT go,” arguing concerns over the provision can’t get in the way of passing the bill. <strong>He signaled he was supportive of raising the SALT deduction from $10,000 to $30,000 for anyone making $400,000 or less</strong> — the proposal currently in the bill that members of the SALT Caucus have vocally rejected. -The Hill</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump's appearance at the nearly two-hour meeting didn't move the needle much, however.</p>

<p>"The president I don’t think convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way it is," said Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, whose members are among the loudest critics of the massive spending package. "I can’t support it the way it is right now," Harris added.</p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile, </strong>Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), a prominent SALT Caucus member, said "While I respect the president, I’m not budging on it."</p>

<p>So, it all comes down to SALT.</p>

Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Short Seller Challenges Jimmy Fallon To $1M Air Taxi Bet Before 2028 LA Olympics</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Archer Aviation is set to serve as the <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/los-angeles-announces-flying-taxis-visitors-no-car-olympics">official air taxi provider</a> for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles—a high-profile partnership that has boosted the startup's public visibility. However, skepticism mounts over whether Archer can deliver a fully operational flying taxi aircraft ahead of the Games.</p>

<p>Short seller Culper Research has released a scathing report on Archer Aviation, alleging that the startup has "systematically misled, deceived, or outright lied" investors about nearly every significant milestone tied to developing and testing its eVTOL aircraft, Midnight.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_14-18-20.png?itok=Pvdvw4gF" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_14-18-20.png?itok=Pvdvw4gF"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1ac67824-afa4-431d-9455-8491e392db3b" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="347" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-20_14-18-20.png?itok=Pvdvw4gF" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>"Archer's misrepresentations have grown increasingly brazen as it attempts to conceal a far more deep-seated, and – in the Company's very own words – "potentially catastrophic" problem: Midnight's sham transition flight and underlying instability. In our view, Archer's continued promotion of near-term commercialization is not only premature, but reckless," Culper wrote in the report.</p>

<p>Culper claimed Midnight was "nowhere close to flying," and pointed out that Archer CEO Adam Goldstein has been more focused on running promotions, such as appearing on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show last Thursday. </p>

<p>"Our sources suggest, however, Archer paid millions for the airtime, in addition to Fallon's recent appearance at an Archer promotional event in NYC," the short seller wrote, adding, "We reached out to Fallon's agent who told us that we, too, could have Jimmy show up at our party (to say nothing of his appearance in a promotional video) for about $600,000, plus transportation."</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, Culper wrote on X, "We are short Archer Aviation - and we're extending a $1 million wager to Jimmy Fallon, who has earned millions to promote Archer. Jimmy - if you truly believe in Archer, prove it."</p>

Title: How Hackers Can Control Your Phone With "Zero-Click" Attack
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How Hackers Can Control Your Phone With "Zero-Click" Attack</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/how-hackers-can-control-your-phone-without-you-clicking-on-a-link-5853147?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge">Authored by Chris Summers via The Epoch Times</a> (emphasis ours),</em></p>

<p>In 2025, most people are inseparable from their laptops and smartphones. With that familiarity has come a wariness of the dangers of clicking on unsolicited emails, SMS, or WhatsApp messages.</p>

<p><strong>But there is a growing menace called zero-click attacks, which have previously targeted only VIPs or the very wealthy because of their cost and sophistication.</strong></p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2860%29_0.jpg?itok=WwC7_dhw" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2860%29_0.jpg?itok=WwC7_dhw"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ecec102a-9eb3-4ef4-a95b-2072ddc174d0" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2860%29_0.jpg?itok=WwC7_dhw" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Illustration by The Epoch Times, Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p><strong>A zero-click attack is a cyberattack that hacks a device without the user clicking anything.</strong> It can happen just by receiving a message, call, or file. The attacker uses hidden flaws in apps or systems to take control of the device, with no action needed from the user and the user remains unaware of the attack.</p>

<p>“Although public awareness has increased recently, these attacks have steadily evolved over many years, becoming more frequent as smartphones and connected devices proliferated,” Nathan House, CEO of StationX, a UK-based cybersecurity training platform, told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p>“<strong>The key vulnerability is in the software, rather than the type of device, meaning any connected device with exploitable weaknesses could potentially be targeted,</strong>” he said.</p>

<p>Aras Nazarovas, an information security researcher at Cybernews, told The Epoch Times why <strong>zero-click attacks usually target VIPs,</strong> rather than ordinary individuals.</p>

<p>“S<strong>ince finding such zero-click exploits is difficult and expensive</strong>, most of the time such exploits are used to gain access to information from key figures, such as politicians or journalists in authoritarian regimes,” he said.</p>

<p>“They are often used in targeted campaigns. Using such exploits to steal money is rare.”</p>

<p>In June 2024, the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cl770d121gro">reported</a> that social media platform TikTok had admitted that a “very limited” number of accounts, including those of media outlet CNN, had been compromised.</p>

<p>While ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, did not confirm the nature of the hack, cybersecurity companies such as Kaspersky and Assured Intelligence <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/tik-tok-vulnerability-zero-click/27685/">suggested</a> it stemmed from a zero-click exploit.</p>

<p>“<strong>The part that requires high levels of sophistication is finding bugs that allow such attacks and writing exploits for these bugs,</strong>” Nazarovas said.</p>

<p>“It has been a billion-dollar market for years, selling zero-click exploits and exploit chains. Some gray/dark market exploit brokers often offer $500,000 to $1 million for such exploit chains for popular devices and apps.”</p>

<p>Nazarovas added that while ordinary users have been hit in the past by zero-click ‘drive-by’ attacks. These are <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/drive-by-download#:~:text=A%20drive%2Dby%20download%20attack,to%20actively%20enable%20the%20attack.">attacks</a> that emerge after the unintentional installation of malicious software onto a device, often without the user even realizing it. They have become more infrequent with the growing gray market for such exploits.</p>

<p>House said zero-click exploits often seek out vulnerabilities in software and apps that are expensive to discover, which means the perpetrators are usually “nation-state actors or highly-funded groups.”</p>

<h2>Expanded Spyware Markets</h2>

<p>Although there have been recent innovations in AI that have made certain cyber crimes, such as voice-cloning or <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/the-terrifying-way-scammers-clone-your-voice-to-defraud-your-family-5849310">vishing</a>, more prevalent, Nazarovas says there is no evidence yet that it has increased the risk from zero-click attacks.</p>

<p><strong>House said people could use AI to “write zero-click exploit chains for people who would have otherwise lacked the time, experience, or knowledge to be able to discover and write such exploits.”</strong></p>

<p>But, he said, the increase in zero-click attacks in recent years, “stems mainly from expanded spyware markets and greater availability of sophisticated exploits, rather than directly from AI-driven techniques.”</p>

<p>He said <strong>zero-click attacks have existed for more than a decade</strong>, the most infamous of which was the Pegasus <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/the-international-spyware-scandal-runs-deeper-than-pegasus-3915927">spyware</a> affair.</p>

<p>In July 2021, The Guardian and 16 other media outlets published a series of articles, alleging that foreign governments used the Israeli-based NSO Group’s Pegasus software to surveil at least 180 journalists and numerous other targets around the world.</p>

<p>Alleged targets of Pegasus surveillance included French President Emmanuel Macron, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, and Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi, who was slain in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/Newses/following-the-publication-of-the-recent-article-by-forbidden-stories-we-wanted-to-directly-address-the-false-accusations-and-misleading-allegations-presented-there/">statement</a> at the time, NSO Group said, “As NSO has previously stated, our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.”</p>

<p>On May 6, a California jury <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/jury-awards-meta-168-million-in-whatsapp-spyware-case-5853795">awarded</a> WhatsApp’s parent company, Meta, $444,719 in compensatory damages and $167.3 million in punitive damages, in a privacy case against NSO Group.</p>

<p>The WhatsApp complaint was focused on the Pegasus spyware, which, according to the lawsuit, was developed “to be remotely installed and enable the remote access and control of information—including calls, messages, and location—on mobile devices using the Android, iOS, and BlackBerry operating systems.”</p>

<p>“<strong>While ordinary users can occasionally become collateral targets, attackers generally reserve these costly exploits for individuals whose information is especially valuable or sensitive,</strong>” Nazarovas said.</p>

<p>According to Nazarovas, corporations offer hackers ‘bug bounties’ to incentivize them to find these exploits and report them to the company, rather than selling them to a broker who then sells them on to parties who use them illegally.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>SRIRAM KRISHAN: We signed the first AI acceleration partnership. You guys probably read about in the press, but there are probably three important components that just, I wanted to have the technology brothers have the alpha and the have the first group on that. <strong>The most important part, the first part, is that this represents a large investment in U.S. data centers and U.S. AI infrastructure</strong>. So these countries will be investing in U.S. AI infrastructure. To make them as equal, if not larger, than the data centers and infrastructure they're building back home. So this means, obviously a large infusion of capital revenue to data centers here in America. </p>

<p>JORDI HAYS: <strong>That story was kind of lost. Right? I feel like a lot of the focus was on localized investment and infrastructure. </strong></p>

<p>JOHN COOGAN: To break it down in language that a venture capitalist could understand. This is something like what we're seeing with Stargate where <strong>there's a ton of capital forming and that's coming from SoftBank, but it's also coming from Middle Eastern investment funds and sovereign nations investing in American infrastructure.</strong> And then there's a whole host of companies that might come in the stack to actually build a new data center. Is that right?</p>

<p>SRIRAM KRISHAN: Exactly. You should be doing our talking points. I would say, look, <strong>these countries have AI ambitions, right? They want to buy American AI. They wanna buy our semiconductors.</strong> They want to buy our large language model. They want to use us. And so as a part of this deal, they're agreeing to a few things. The most important thing they're gonna agree to is that capital, like you mentioned, right? Like, and, and this is, by the way, net new. This is not part of any existing project. Sure. These net new deals will mean infrastructure being built out physically in the US.</p>

<p><strong>So for example, if they build out X megawatts of gigawatts of capacity, yep. This will mean the same X megawatts of gigawatts of capacity in the US, and this is an important point.</strong> Because some of the chatter has been, Hey, how does America maintain its lead? Well, one of the ways we maintain our lead is everything that is being built up by our allies. We get a matching deal back home. So that's probably the number one headline.</p>

<p>The second headline would be that <strong>the vast majority of the GPUs that are as a part of this deal, which is gonna be, say, hosted in the UAE, will be hosted, run, operated by American hyperscaler companies, right? </strong>And so, you probably know them all, right? These would be large American companies who. <strong>They will be running it, hosting it, maintaining, and this is actually important because this represents an expansion opportunity for all of our companies</strong>. This means they would get to win market share away from competition from other countries. And obviously there's a whole huge amount of revenue and ecosystem coming in. <strong>And so that's the second key point, the vast majority of the GPUs are going to be run by American companies, often by a lot of our friends in these large, uh, you know, hyperscaler companies.</strong></p>

<p>And the third point, and this is, again, something just lost in the chatter, is I'm sure you've heard questions about, <strong>Hey, how do we make sure these GPUs, you know, don't get to somebody they don't need to be</strong>. So there are rigorous security protocols in place, so every GPU gets shipped over. We are gonna make sure that, a., they can't be physically diverted. These are really large boxes. You can't hide them under your t-shirt or your tux and kind of stick them out the door<strong>. You can't really go George Clooney Oceans 11 on them. So one is there's going to be a large amount of physical verification and physical security protocols.</strong></p>

<p>The second is remote access. We are gonna make sure through these deals, through the framework that nobody who's not supposed to have access, especially from countries of concern, can get access.</p>

<p><strong>And so these three kinds of the core pillars, and here's why this event, right?</strong> And I think everybody in your audience who's like a technology person, a technology brother, or in the software world, here's why they'll understand it. What has history taught as a software industry? The company with the biggest network effect, the biggest ecosystem wins, right? <strong>We've all grown up with Microsoft. How did Microsoft win with the Windows and Office ecosystem? Think about this as the American AI ecosystem.</strong></p>

<p>We are getting these resource-rich countries who are critical allies in very interesting geopolitical places to basically adopt the American AI stack, right? Up and down. This means <strong>they are going to be part of our ecosystem for years and decades to come</strong>, and it essentially forms a shield from them ever adopting or using technology or working closely with some people that we don't want them to work with. In a way, I kind of think of this like a software ecosystem play, where we now have them tied to the American AI ecosystem.</p>

Title: Trump Unveils $175 Billion Plan For "Golden Dome" Missile Defense System
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Trump Unveils $175 Billion Plan For "Golden Dome" Missile Defense System</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>By Ryan Morgan of <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/design-selected-for-golden-dome-missile-defense-plan-trump-announces-5860756?utm_source=Goodevening&src_src=Goodevening&utm_campaign=gv-2025-05-20&src_cmp=gv-2025-05-20&utm_medium=email&est=qST%2FIH4DR4fqwQ25iG0z%2FpHk7eNTzES3en88GqT0I3FBNW68Oe0qK3q%2BBDkd34k%2F3Q%3D%3D">Epoch Times</a></em></p>

<p>The Department of Defense has selected a design for President Donald Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense initiative, Trump announced on May 20.</p>

<p>“I’m pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,” Trump told reporters at the White House.</p>

<p>In his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Defense to devise a plan to implement his missile defense proposal.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/trump%20golden%20dome.jpg?itok=AjqGMpp6" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/trump%20golden%20dome.jpg?itok=AjqGMpp6"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cecb6896-71b9-4bb6-b21d-b698946dea0e" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="331" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/trump%20golden%20dome.jpg?itok=AjqGMpp6" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>“It should be fully operational before the end of my term. So we'll have it done in about three years,” the president said.</p>

<p>Trump said the plan the Department of Defense has selected should cost about $175 billion to complete.</p>

<p>The plan will meld new technologies with existing U.S. missile defense systems.</p>

<p>Canada may also partner with the United States to help develop the improved missile defense shield, the president said. “Canada wants to be a part of it, which would be a fairly small expansion, but we'll work with them on pricing.”</p>

<p>In addition to new and improved space-based sensors and interceptors, Trump’s January executive order called for the Department of Defense to consider non-kinetic missile interception technologies such as lasers.</p>

<p>The order also tasked the department with examining methods and technologies for intercepting missile threats before they can launch, or in their initial boost phase.</p>

<p>Standing beside Trump during the Oval Office announcement, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth noted the parallels between Trump’s missile defense proposal and the Strategic Defense Initiative put forth by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative included a number of aspirational missile defense concepts, and some critics referred to it as Reagan’s “Star Wars” proposal.</p>

<p>“President Reagan, 40 years ago, cast the vision for it. The technology wasn’t there. Now it is, and you’re following through,” Hegseth told the president.</p>

<p>Congressional Republicans have put forth a $150 billion supplemental military spending package, with about $25 billion set aside to kickstart the Golden Dome project. The $150 billion defense spending plan is one piece of a larger bill that Trump and his allies are hoping to pass through the reconciliation process, avoiding a potential Senate filibuster.</p>

<p>Trump expressed confidence that the reconciliation bill will pass.</p>

<p>“We’ve already spoken to everybody that we have to speak to,” he said.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s in line.”</p>

<p>Adding to his Golden Dome announcement on Tuesday, Trump named Gen. Michael Guetlein, vice chief of space operations for the U.S. Space Force, as the program manager for the project.</p>

Title: US Veteran Freed From Venezuelan Prison After Latest Trump Diplomacy With Maduro
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">US Veteran Freed From Venezuelan Prison After Latest Trump Diplomacy With Maduro</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>In another diplomatic win for the Trump administration, a US Air Force veteran unlawfully imprisoned in Venezuela has been released on Tuesday, following secret talks with President Nicolás Maduro's representatives and Trump's special envoy Ric Grenell.</p>

<p>Joseph St. Clair, a 33-year-old combat-disabled veteran, had been <strong>detained in Venezuela since November</strong>, and was <strong>one of nine Americans declared by Washington as 'wrongfully detained'</strong>.</p>

<p>Few initial details of his release or the terms of any possible deal or incentives offered Maduro have not been forthcoming. However, Grenell's talks with Venezuelan officials, reportedly in Antigua, <strong>likely focused on both oil and the migrant crisis</strong>.</p>

<p>Conservative news outlet <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/us/venezuela-ric-grenell-joseph-st-clair/2025/05/20/id/1211648/"><em>Newsmax</em></a> says it "learned that Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday <strong>extended the waivers for U.S. companies' oil licenses in Venezuela by 60 days</strong>."</p>

<p>Clearly the Maduro government is ready to engage in top-level negotiations with Washington, in hopes for sanctions relief, and in return it is likely also willing to take back migrants.</p>

<p>According to background on St. Clair's arrest <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-05-06/veteran-service-member-venezuela-prison-detained-17704313.html">last year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Air Force veteran Joe St. Clair, their 33-year-old son, was <strong>traveling as a tourist near the Venezuelan border in October 2024 when he and a friend from Colombia were arrested by Venezuelan authorities, who transported them across the border to a Venezuelan prison,</strong> his family said. “We learned that Joe decided to take a trip near the border with one of his friends to visit [the friend’s] family member and got too close to the border and got abducted by the Venezuelan police,” Scott St. Clair explained. </em></p>

<p><em>“They were shaken down, questioned and searched. All their possessions were taken.” St. Clair said he was told the border is “fluid,” and that Venezuelan authorities detain Americans as bargaining chips to gain leverage against the U.S. to ease restrictions placed on the country. Joe is a linguist who served as a tech sergeant in the Air Force until 2019. He was honorably discharged after nine years of service, his family said.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He had actually been deployed on four combat tours in Afghanistan. It's unclear whether the two travelers were inside Venezuelan territory or not.</p>

<p><em>This follows an initial big release of six Americans from Venezuela back in late January...</em></p>

Title: Australia's Unrealized Gains Tax Will Be A Lesson In Economic Suicide
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Australia's Unrealized Gains Tax Will Be A Lesson In Economic Suicide</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>Submitted by <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/australias-unrealized-gain-tax-plan">QTR's Fringe Finance</a></em></p>

<p>I’ve spent <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/taxing-unrealized-gains-would-obliterate?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">years warning about the economic dangers</a> of policies that attempt to tax wealth before it’s realized, and now, like a slow-motion train wreck, we’re about to witness exactly why those warnings matter.</p>

<p>Australia’s <a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/business/financial-commentators-lash-labor-for-targeting-unrealised-capital-gains-in-super-warn-of-potential-extensions-to-other-assets/news-story/05ef5fc57f5c5f8e75ff405023693591" rel="">new move to tax unrealized capital gains</a> is one of the most reckless policy decisions I’ve ever seen — and keep in mind, I had front row seats to an “Inflation Reduction Act” that added more than $1 trillion in spending.</p>

<p>Taxing unrealized gains is equal parts <em>outright f*cking mathematically insane </em>and <em>cut-and-dry </em>authoritarian. And while I’m appalled by the policy itself, there’s a perverse part of me that’s almost glad it’s happening in Australia first—because the disastrous results will be on full display for the world to see.</p>

<p>Starting in July 2025, the Albanese government is set to debut its latest economic masterstroke: taxing imaginary money. That’s right—if you’ve got more than $3 million sitting in your superannuation, not only will you get slapped with a 30% tax, but it doesn’t even matter if you actually <em>made</em> any money.</p>

<p>Didn’t sell anything? Didn’t cash out? Never saw a cent? Tough luck—Big Brother took a peek at your account, saw some numbers went up, and decided you owe them a slice of your hypothetical success.</p>

<p>This isn’t just bending the rules of how taxation and private property works—it’s snapping them clean in half and using the pieces to beat your rights to death. For as long as economies have existed, the deal was simple: you sell an asset, you make a profit, and then you pay tax. You know, <em>after</em> you’ve actually made money. Because taxing cash that doesn’t exist yet is the kind of thing you expect from crackheads playing Monopoly, not national policy.</p>

<p>But here we are. Australia is now sprinting headfirst toward a future where you get billed for wealth that isn’t liquid, isn’t realized, and, if the market tanks tomorrow, might never even <em>exist</em>. It’s like being forced to pay income tax on the raise your boss <em>almost</em> gave you but didn’t, or footing the bill for the lottery jackpot on the billboard on the side of I-95 that you didn’t win.</p>

<p>The fallout is not rocket science. People will be forced to liquidate assets—probably the wrong ones, at the worst possible time—just to scrape together enough <em>real</em> money to cover taxes on their <em>fake</em> money. Don’t have the cash lying around to pay that bill? Sounds like a <em>you</em> problem. Better start liquidating. And this isn’t just stocks we’re talking about. Real estate? Private businesses? Long-term investments you hold precisely because they’re supposed to be safe and stable? All fair game in a fire sale.</p>

<p>But wait, it gets even better. That $3 million threshold? It’s not even indexed to inflation. So as the value of money inevitably erodes, more and more regular people will find themselves dragged into this mess. It’s like the $1,200 handpay rule in Atlantic City and Las Vegas: it was created in the 1800s when $1,200 was enough to buy a private island, but as the purchasing power of the dollar has eroded, the rule has been kept in place, with the recalibration serving as way to monitor more and more transactions.</p>

<hr /><p>With these unrealized gains, today it’s “only the rich,” but tomorrow it’s anyone who happened to save diligently or saw their house value rise because some genius decided to inflate the housing market even more.</p>

<p>So, if you’re sitting there thinking, “Well, that won’t affect me,” just wait. You might not be rich enough for the government’s shakedown <em>yet</em>, but thanks to inflation and asset bubbles, they’ll be at your door before you can say “unrealized gains.”</p>

<p>Back in 2024, I wrote <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/taxing-unrealized-gains-would-obliterate?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">about why taxing unrealized gains</a> in the U.S. would be a catastrophic policy error. I warned that it would lead to forced sales, create liquidity crises, and punish anyone who dares to invest in volatile or long-term assets. Investors will avoid riskier assets that fluctuate in value because even a temporary increase could trigger a tax liability before they’ve seen any real return. This creates a chilling effect on investment in startups, innovation, and anything with a long payoff horizon.</p>

<p>It would also cause monstrous capital flight out of the U.S., as I’m guessing we’ll soon see in Australia.</p>

<p>Then there’s the bureaucratic nightmare of it all. Valuing assets for tax purposes every single year is an administrative quagmire. How do you accurately value a private business annually? How do you value collectibles, real estate, or other non-liquid assets in a way that’s fair and consistent? The government doesn’t have that kind of precision, and neither do most investors. What you end up with is a system riddled with errors, disputes, and compliance headaches for both taxpayers and the government.</p>

<p>Yet despite all these glaring problems, Australia is going through with it. And while I genuinely feel for the Australians who are about to suffer the consequences of this insanity, there’s also a silver lining. The rest of the world is watching. This is about to become the textbook case study in how not to run an economy. If you want to see what happens when a government taxes phantom wealth and forces people to pay cash they don’t have, just keep your eyes on Australia over the next few years.</p>

<p>My prediction? You’ll see a mass exodus of capital. People will restructure their investments, move funds offshore, and pull money out of productive sectors of the economy. You’ll see market volatility as investors dump assets to avoid future tax liabilities. You’ll watch the property market distort as people chase after tax shelters. And ultimately, you’ll see economic growth grind down under the weight of a policy that punishes investment and rewards government overreach.</p>

<p>In a strange way, I’m thankful this is happening—not because I support it, but because it will stand as a stark, irrefutable warning to every other country foolish enough to consider the same policy. The Australian government is about to run a live experiment in economic self-sabotage, and the results will be undeniable. In my opinion, after this plays out, no serious policymaker with a shred of economic literacy will be able to look at the forthcoming outcomes and still argue that taxing unrealized gains is anything but a disastrously stupid idea.</p>

<p>Amid a flurry of administrative rule changes, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2023/05/16/biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-11-billion-investment-advance-clean-energy-across-rural">prioritized government-backed Farm Credit</a> lending for <a href="https://farmcredit.com/stories/pedernales-electric-cooperative/">rural utilities</a>.

<p>Simultaneously, as part of the ELTRR's "<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Full-PREPARE-Plan.pdf">whole-of-government</a>" approach; the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/09/2024-09233/new-source-performance-standards-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-new-modified-and-reconstructed">exempted</a> certain "Green Energy" infrastructure projects, such as solar and carbon capture from Environmental Impact Studies, while 45Q tax credits promised billions in government subsidies, and agencies <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-08736/page-36910">eased land acquisition</a> regulations for "Federally Assisted Programs."</p>

<p>This coalescence created a proverbial gold rush. Suddenly, private equity firms like <strong>Blackrock and Vanguard</strong> quickly began backing projects for <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2023/05/31/princeton-maps-ccs-us-plans-co2-pipeline-buildout/">Carbon Sequestration infrastructure</a>, such as the 2,500-mile C02 pipeline project spanning five states. </p>

<p>Now, as Congress works to immediately halt IRA funding and reign-in the <strong>"whole-of-government," state lawmakers and agricultural advocates warn the cure could exacerbate the disease.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to Amanda Radke</strong>, a fifth-generation cattle rancher who has fought against giving private corporations eminent domain power in South Dakota, "this proposal would open the door for federal overreach and eminent domain abuse, especially with the $10 million price tag to fast-track these projects."</p>

<p>"<strong>I'm deeply concerned that the current proposal for the budget reconciliation bill will grant centralized federal authority over the permitting of carbon dioxide pipelines</strong>," Radke said. "<strong>This Green New Deal has held America hostage for far too long, and it's time for Congress to cut ties with this boondoggle once and for all. Landowners across the nation are calling for Congress to cut wasteful spending, halt the subsidies of the IRA like the 45Q tax credit, and protect our private property rights</strong>." </p>

<p>S.D. landowners have also found a fierce advocate in <a href="https://www.thedakotascout.com/p/carbon-pipeline-opponents-win-key">Speaker of the House, Rep. Jon Hansen</a>. Hansen, who is now running for Governor,  and running-mate Rep. Karla Lems, have <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2025/03/03/carbon-pipeline-eminent-domain-ban-advances-sd-legislature-compromise-bill-gutted/">led the charge to protect private property rights</a> in the State of South Dakota. </p>

<p>However, according to Hansen, these hard-won efforts could now be a moot point. </p>

<p>"<strong>President Trump has made it very clear that he wants to end the Green New Deal scam</strong>. In spite of that, politicians in Washington are trying to sneak a provision deep in the budget bill that would override the hard-fought protections that we have put into place for farmers, ranchers, and land owners in South Dakota," Hansen told ZeroHedge.</p>

<p>While GOP leadership has made quiet promises that the bill will be amended, an updated draft has yet to materialize prior to Wednesday's vote. A fact that isn't sitting well with Radke or Hansen.</p>

<p>"<strong>While we've been told this language would be cut on Wednesday morning</strong>, farmers and ranchers are waiting for reassurance from Congressional leaders that our land is, in fact, not for sale to the highest bidder," Radke said. </p>

<p>For Hansen, however, anything short of killing this section, <strong>will be considered an absolute failure</strong>.</p>

<p>"<u><strong>All members of Congress must reject this proposal</strong></u>," Hansen said. "Anything short of killing the land grab proposal and totally defunding the 45Q tax credit is an absolute failure to deliver on ending the green new deal scam and a failure to defend our peoples' constitutional rights."</p>

<p><em><strong>The US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities</strong>, even as the Trump administration has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/17/middleeast/iran-trump-nuclear-talks-intl">pursuing a diplomatic deal</a> with Tehran, multiple US officials familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.</em></p>

<p>The United Kingdom on Tuesday suspended its free-trade agreement negotiations with Israel over the growing Gaza crisis, and after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed disgust at newly expanded Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, also as famine threats at least 500,000 Palestinians.</p>

<p>Starmer described that he and his French and Canadian counterparts are "horrified" by the Netanyahu government's escalation in Gaza. This also comes as international headlines and warnings grow more dire. For example Al Jazeera has the following new <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/5/20/live-israeli-allies-say-they-will-take-concrete-actions-over-gaza-siege">headline</a>: <strong>"Starving Palestinians resort to eating animal feed, flour mixed with sand"</strong>.</p>

<p>"<strong>We repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the hostages</strong>, we repeat our opposition to settlements in the West Bank, and we repeat our demand to massively scale up humanitarian assistance into Gaza," Starmer told parliament.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/lammyisrael.jpg?itok=QTrmQPpd" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/lammyisrael.jpg?itok=QTrmQPpd"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="63af1bf0-9307-4309-bd42-783b7566f911" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/lammyisrael.jpg?itok=QTrmQPpd" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>David Lammy with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, via GPO</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>A Monday <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/20/uk-france-and-canada-threaten-concrete-actions-against-israel">joint statement</a> by the UK, France and Canada had threatened sanctions on Israel. Britain further did slap <strong>targeted sanctions on Israeli settler groups</strong> and individuals. </p>

<p>Later on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy voiced agreement with Starmer, saying that Israel’s actions are "morally wrong" and "unjustifiable." He also said of the fresh sanctions, "I have seen for myself the consequences of settler violence. The fear of its victims. The impunity of its perpetrators."</p>

<p>In announcing the pause in free-trade agreement negotiations, Lammy further revealed that the <strong>Israeli ambassador had been summoned</strong>. Britain is reportedly demanding the full resumption of humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Responding to shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Lammy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/may/20/uk-eu-deal-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-gulf-nations-politic-live-news-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-682c85998f08a5e9325ebad3">told parliament</a>:</p>

<blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline">
<p><em>I think the whole house should be able to utterly condemn the Israeli government’s denial of food to hungry children. It is wrong. It’s appalling.</em></p>

<p><em>Opposing the expansion of a war that has killed thousands of children is not rewarding Hamas. Opposing the displacement of 100,000s of civilians is not rewarding Hamas. On this side of the house, we are crystal clear that what is happening is morally wrong, unjustifiable, and it needs to stop.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting Friday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced an expanded mobilization of troops for operation 'Gideon's Chariots'. Some two million Palestinians are <strong>expected to be forced into a "humanitarian zone" </strong>while most of the enclave is destroyed and flattened.</p>

<p>The policy somewhat contradicts Trump's main messaging during last week's Gulf tour, wherein he emphasized peace through deal-making, and not 'chaos' in the war-torn Middle East. </p>

<p>This is probably <strong>the most pressure Israel has come under from its Western allies since Oct.7, 2023</strong>. As we previously reported, even Vice President JD Vance <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/vance-abruptly-cancels-israel-visit-idf-expands-gaza-operations">abruptly canceled</a> a planned trip to Israel following the Netanyahu government's declaration that it would ramp up operations to conquer all of Gaza.</p>

<p><i>Meanwhile the domestic policy fight within Israel has been ramping up too...</i></p>

Title: After Credit Downgrade, Maryland's Leftist Governor Torpedoes Reparations Bill To Avoid Political Blowback
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">After Credit Downgrade, Maryland's Leftist Governor Torpedoes Reparations Bill To Avoid Political Blowback</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>The optics are grim for far-left Maryland Governor Wes Moore. As the state grapples with a fiscal crisis (deficit explosion), a credit downgrade, illegal alien invasion, violent crime, the looming threat of resident and business flight, a potential tsunami of new taxes, and a worsening power crisis, Moore is facing a growing backlash from all Marylanders. His ability to lead is increasingly being questioned—and it's becoming clear he's far from presidential material.</p>

<p>Moore has managed to anger both sides of the political aisle. The latest outrage comes from within his own party after he vetoed a bill that would have established a state commission to study and recommend reparations for African Americans affected by slavery.</p>

<p>In a letter explaining his decision, Moore said it's not the time for another study, emphasizing the need for direct action to address racial disparities such as the wealth gap, homeownership, education, and food insecurity.</p>

<p>"I will always protect and defend the full history of African Americans in our state and country," Moore wrote in his letter, adding, "But in light of the many important studies that have taken place on this issue over nearly three decades, now is the time to focus on the work itself: Narrowing the racial wealth gap, expanding homeownership, uplifting entrepreneurs of color, and closing the foundational disparities that lead to inequality — from food insecurity to education."</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/fa2f702e-7d36-4dbd-9acd-ba4806045c51-jumbo3x1_Gov.WesMooresatdownwithpoliticalcommentatorArmstrongWilliamsinAnnapolisonAug.22.png?itok=wTSoaAh1" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/fa2f702e-7d36-4dbd-9acd-ba4806045c51-jumbo3x1_Gov.WesMooresatdownwithpoliticalcommentatorArmstrongWilliamsinAnnapolisonAug.22.png?itok=wTSoaAh1"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dfc791d0-3709-411e-ad98-3a032e477097" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="269" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/fa2f702e-7d36-4dbd-9acd-ba4806045c51-jumbo3x1_Gov.WesMooresatdownwithpoliticalcommentatorArmstrongWilliamsinAnnapolisonAug.22.png?itok=wTSoaAh1" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>He continued: "We have moved in partnership with leaders across the state to uplift Black families and address racial disparities in our communities. That is the context in which I've made this difficult decision. Because while I appreciate the work that went into this legislation, <strong>I strongly believe now is not the time for another study. </strong>Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve."</p>

<p>Moore's rationale—more likely crafted by his advisors—appears rooted in political optics. These far-left redistribution programs are so detached from capitalist principles and Western values that they risk being deeply unpopular, especially at a time when Maryland's finances are unraveling after decades of Democratic overspending and an economy overly dependent on government funding.</p>

<p>We suspect Moore's veto has also angered hardline Marxist Democrats in the state, who continue to push for socialist systems that redistribute wealth from the productive to the less productive. Under the current leadership of activist progressives, Maryland is on a death spiral—and it's not us saying this—but some leaders of some of the largest companies that operate in the Baltimore area have told us this.</p>

<p>With Democrats furious over Moore's veto of the reparations bill, the governor has now managed to infuriate both sides of the political aisle.</p>

<p>The Maryland Legislative Black Caucus was not pleased with Moore: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"The state's first black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Maryland's financial outlook continues to deteriorate, with a $3 billion budget shortfall looming—likely paving the way for new taxes and triggering yet another wave of resident flight.</p>

<p>Since 1973, Maryland has maintained a top-tier credit rating, long seen as a reflection of fiscal discipline and responsible governance. However, far-left Democrats in Annapolis have chosen to run deficits to fund their progressive pet projects. This credit downgrade puts Maryland on the disastrous pathway toward becoming "<strong>Illinois 2.0."</strong></p>

<p>“I think it’s disgraceful that we’re going to set up a reparations tax that might tax one race and give to another race all in the name of equity,” Matthew Morgan, a Republican delegate, said in April before voting against the bill.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-governor-vetoes-reparations-bill-says-its-not-time-for-another-study-5860075?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge">Epoch Times</a> noted, "Some lawmakers also took issue with the bill's broad language, which gave the proposed commission wide discretion in defining eligibility. They warned that, in theory, this could extend benefits to millions of people across the United States or even the world, costing billions of dollars."</p>

<p>Perhaps Moore should take some personal time—maybe at the upscale Caves Valley Golf Club, where sources say he is a member—and reflect on his state strategy while paying a round of golf. With crises piling up well before Trump's second term began, Moore has yet to demonstrate strong leadership Maryland needs.</p>

Title: Working Out Is Right Wing, And That's A Good Thing
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Working Out Is Right Wing, And That's A Good Thing</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://amgreatness.com/2025/05/20/working-out-is-right-wing-and-thats-a-good-thing/"><em>Authored by Braeden Sorbo via American Greatness,</em></a></p>

<p><em><strong>The media has a new villain: fitness...</strong></em></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_11-34-09.jpg?itok=tWmOud4M" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-20_11-34-09.jpg?itok=tWmOud4M"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c857915-8485-4f03-80e8-8408780fcd56" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="287" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-20_11-34-09.jpg?itok=tWmOud4M" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>According to recent articles, engaging in physical exercise is now linked to right-wing extremism. </strong></p>

<p>The narrative suggests that lifting weights, building discipline, and taking responsibility for your body are somehow dangerous acts. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/03/getting-fit-could-turn-you-into-a-rightwing-jerk"><em>The Guardian</em></a> claims that getting in shape could turn you into a “right-wing jerk,” while <a href="https://time.com/6242949/exercise-industry-white-supremacy/"><em>TIME</em> </a>runs pieces on “the white supremacist origins of exercise.” <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/pandemic-fitness-trends-have-gone-extreme-literally-n1292463">MSNBC </a>warns that during the pandemic, workout trends ended up leading to “extreme” ideologies.</p>

<p><strong>Seriously? Can we just stop with the nonsense?</strong></p>

<p>I’ll tell you the real reason fitness is under attack. It breeds autonomy. And autonomous men are a threat to systems built on dependence and compliance.</p>

<p><strong>Allow me to be controversial: physical strength and mental resilience are connected. </strong>According to a 2022 study published in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.859117/full"><em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, individuals who maintain regular physical activity demonstrate significantly higher psychological resilience and lower levels of anxiety and depression. When you commit to training your body, you’re also training your mind. You’re learning delayed gratification. You’re becoming comfortable with discomfort. You’re developing the backbone to say no—to weak ideas, to bad leadership, to mob thinking. In other words, weak people are agreeable, which is exactly what the government wants.</p>

<p>Testosterone plays a central role in this. Individuals with higher levels of testosterone flowing through their bodies are more likely to question authority and even think for themselves. A 2015 review in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330791/"><em>Biological Psychiatry</em></a> explained that testosterone influences areas of the brain involved in motivation, emotional regulation, and social behavior, helping men navigate challenges with clarity and confidence.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! Another study in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6742992/"><em>PNAS</em> </a>(2019) directly debunked the myth that testosterone reduces empathy, showing no evidence that it impairs cognitive empathy at all. Translation: Higher testosterone doesn’t make you a bad person. It makes you sharper, more focused, and more prepared to lead.</p>

<p><strong>So why the war on fitness? Because fit, strong, disciplined men are harder to control.</strong></p>

<p>They don’t break down from online shaming. They don’t beg bureaucracies for handouts. They know how to fight—metaphorically and literally—and that makes them dangerous to anyone trying to neuter society. As <a href="https://youtu.be/sP37wxRUJVk?si=wtcgn3Y5zA85eNwk">Jordan Peterson</a> once said, “A harmless man is <em>not</em> a good man. A good man is a very, very dangerous man who has it under voluntary control.”</p>

<p>When you’re physically able to defend yourself, you become dangerous—in the best way. The world thrives on intimidation. That’s why so many people—especially young women—go along with destructive ideas like abortion or men in women’s sports. Deep down, they know something’s off. But fear keeps them quiet. Now take a man who’s strong, capable, and confident—traits often earned through training—and you have someone who can’t be bullied into submission. He doesn’t fold under pressure. He doesn’t need the world’s approval because he knows he can stand on his own.</p>

<p><strong>Without the ability to defend yourself, you stop forming your own opinions. </strong>You become agreeable out of survival instincts. Weakness breeds obedience. What’s been labeled as <em>toxic</em> is actually <em>essential</em>. Without strength, there is no freedom. And without testosterone, there is no original thought—just borrowed scripts and empty slogans. The <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13070-7">stronger </a>the body, the more stable the mind. The more you train your limits, the less likely you are to break under pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Socially, the story is the same.</strong> Parenthood and family responsibility—things once considered pillars of adulthood—are now “conservative red flags.” But the data says otherwise. A 2022 study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9449478/">National Library of Medicine</a> found that becoming a parent consistently predicts a shift toward more conservative values across different cultures. Why? Because raising a child forces you to care about things that extend beyond yourself.</p>

<p>So yes—men who lift, who lead, who protect—are more likely to value tradition, reject chaos, and push back against cultural decay, and that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>If being <a href="https://youtu.be/sP37wxRUJVk?si=wtcgn3Y5zA85eNwk">physically fit</a>, masculine, and protective lands you on a government watchlist, maybe it’s the government that should be watched. </strong>If being strong, loyal, and self-reliant makes you “right-wing,” maybe being right-wing just means you haven’t lost your mind.</p>

<p>The gym isn’t just about vanity and lifting big things. It’s about whether you can defend your home when the need arises. It’s about your son learning to lead, not obey. It’s about your daughter growing up knowing someone strong has her back.</p>

<p><strong>So if working out makes you a right-wing extremist, then we need more gyms.</strong></p>

Title: NH's First Black Sheriff Jailed For Blowing Public Money On Travel With Women
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">NH's First Black Sheriff Jailed For Blowing Public Money On Travel With Women</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A New Hampshire man who was heralded as <strong>the first black sheriff in the state's history was sentenced on Monday to 3 1/2 years in prison for squandering $19,000 of taxpayers' money on expensive getaways with multiple love interests </strong>-- and then lying to investigators about what he'd done. Tightly following the script we've seen so many times before, <strong>the disgraced "barrier-breaker" had previously said fellow Democrats who investigated his crimes were racists, </strong>and that his term in office was "rife with inequities." Despite repeatedly lying to the court and violating his bail conditions, his sentence was a fraction of what prosecutors sought. </p>

<p>At 35 years old, Democrat Mark Brave was <strong>also the youngest-ever sheriff i</strong>n New Hampshire history when he was elected in November 2020 -- following the summer of George Floyd and amid the Black Lives Matter mania that swept the country and helped usher under-qualified blacks into many top roles in and out of law enforcement. "<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-e25df8ff28c8bdf1f8b2fa71c5985001">It’s something I feel should have happened a long time ago</a>, but I’m honored that I will be the person to pave the way,” said Brave at the time. (Alas, some barriers proved insurmountable that year, as a self-described <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e1580367018108b09755dfb994395c0a">transgender Satanist</a> lost the Cheshire County New Hampshire sheriff race.) </p>

That said, <strong>the sentence handed down by lily-white Judge Dan St. Hilaire was far lighter than the seven- to 14-year confinement that prosecutors had requested</strong>. Brave will technically be eligible for parole in 3 1/2 years, but the reality is that <strong>he'll walk even sooner</strong> if he participates in certain prison programs. He must pay $18,969 in restitution to Strafford County. </p>

<p><strong>The judge's leniency was at odds with his characterization of Brave's conduct.</strong> “The court has reviewed a record that has been unlike any other case that has come before it, mainly because of <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/ex-sheriff-mark-brave-sentenced-to-minimum-of-3-years-in-prison-for-perjury/article_e796a635-cf80-43bc-acb8-c62115585286.html">the continuation of the crimes that were being committed while the case was proceeding</a>." The judge was apparently referring to Brave's: </p>

<ul><li>Lying to the grand jury</li>
	<li>Lying on his application for public defense by <a href="https://nhjournal.com/court-brave-tried-to-hide-1-5-million-to-score-free-lawyer/">failing to disclose $1.5 million</a> received on the sale of his home</li>
	<li>Violating his bail conditions by paying $52,000 to lease an apartment in Boston, when he was mandated to remain in New Hampshire; he also traveled to Florida and Puerto Rico</li>
	<li>Lying to the judge, saying he was living in Dover with his ex-wife and that he was out of money</li>
	<li>Failing to disclose his purchase of a 1968 Porsche, though he posted videos and photos of the vehicle to social media</li>
</ul><p>Brave went wild with his county credit card, using it to fund <strong>multiple trips to destinations in Florida, Baltimore and Maryland for getaways with various women </strong>-- with at least some of the trysts happening <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/ex-sheriff-mark-brave-sentenced-to-minimum-of-3-years-in-prison-for-perjury/article_e796a635-cf80-43bc-acb8-c62115585286.html">while Brave was married</a>. He attempted to conceal his misuse of funds by attributing the travel to <strong>fictional business meetings</strong> and training sessions. He also lied to investigators and a grand jury. Some of his lies were exposed by <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2025-05-19/former-strafford-county-sheriff-to-serve-jail-time-for-theft-perjury">hotel lobby security cameras that captured him in the company of women</a> on trips where he claimed to have been traveling alone.      </p>

<p>Brave's misconduct started to unravel when an audit prompted an inquiry into JetBlue tickets purchased for a 2022 trip to Fort Lauderdale. <strong>Not content to merely steal public money, Brave opted for JetBlue's pricey "EvenMore" package</strong>, with the pair of tickets costing $1,615. Defending the expenditure, Brave said he needed the extra room because he's 6' 2" tall, and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lies-mark-brave-told-got-035900280.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE_BmpwckAYhvrEBzBv8I3ybPZbOKcwlbb0oCDA__EDiLYBlReIDyqnECDRL4CwzNm9dGHUKIo11mu6XE-AGFN5XATPMgCFNFjKVwOw5np1UuGSP9y1lFHGpd_PYfY60lDVxicpHerNwroL8u9RISTJJjgZMt0uadmimF0hM6Wpb">claimed he'd traveled with a "well-built, muscular" deputy</a>. Investigators found, however, that he was traveling with female employee.</p>

<p>In <strong>another comical instance</strong> in which he was caught in a lie about a supposed business trip with a colleague, County Administrator Raymond Bower asked Brave why the hotel room only had a single king-bed. "There was a slight pause, and he said, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lies-mark-brave-told-got-035900280.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE_BmpwckAYhvrEBzBv8I3ybPZbOKcwlbb0oCDA__EDiLYBlReIDyqnECDRL4CwzNm9dGHUKIo11mu6XE-AGFN5XATPMgCFNFjKVwOw5np1UuGSP9y1lFHGpd_PYfY60lDVxicpHerNwroL8u9RISTJJjgZMt0uadmimF0hM6Wpb">“Oh, aw, the other person slept on the couch,” </a>Bower said in an affidavit.  He also lied about spending money on business meals associated with meetings with the completely fictional "New England Sheriff's Association." </p>

<p>He also <strong>installed a friend, Freezenia Veras, in a newly-created $80,000 job</strong>, and <a href="https://nhjournal.com/braves-love-life-got-him-in-trouble-but-his-lies-put-him-in-jail/">jetted off to Florida </a>with her for a non-existent consultation with a law enforcement agency. In one of his many lies to a grand jury, Brave denied that he took another woman on a dinner cruise using his county credit card. <strong>When prosecutors whipped out a photo of Brave and the woman,</strong> <strong>he hilariously couldn't come up with her name:</strong> "Her name, her name is … um … let me see, I forget which one this is. I’ve been dating a lot of people,” he told the grand jury, according to <a href="https://nhjournal.com/braves-love-life-got-him-in-trouble-but-his-lies-put-him-in-jail/"><em>NH Journal</em></a>. </p>

<p>Brave also traveled to Maryland to spend time with Kenisha Epps-Schmidt, whom he'd met online. He tried papering over that embezzlement by attributing the trip to a Washington DC meeting with Rep. Chris Pappas that never happened. <strong>Brave proceeded to cheat Epps-Schmidt out of $2,300 she gave him to buy a car </strong>-- <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lies-mark-brave-told-got-035900280.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE_BmpwckAYhvrEBzBv8I3ybPZbOKcwlbb0oCDA__EDiLYBlReIDyqnECDRL4CwzNm9dGHUKIo11mu6XE-AGFN5XATPMgCFNFjKVwOw5np1UuGSP9y1lFHGpd_PYfY60lDVxicpHerNwroL8u9RISTJJjgZMt0uadmimF0hM6Wpb">which he never did</a>.   </p>

<p>Add it all up, and <strong>we have another low-IQ miscreant advanced to a position of authority because he had the right skin color.</strong> That's bad enough, but the black-catering madness carried over over to his sentencing, as a white Republican judge ensured a short stay in prison despite the black defendant's profound and repeated contempt for the criminal justice system all throughout the adjudication of his crime.   </p>

<p>As part of his plea deal, Brave is barred from seeking a law enforcement job during his post-confinement probation. That still leaves him in prime position to become the boyfriend of a leftist congresswoman or a progressive NGO executive and take a salary for providing "security consultant" services. <strong><em><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/cori-bush-private-security">Just axe former Rep.

<p><strong>There are many consequential things we can't discuss factually because the topic upsets everyone.</strong> And since getting upset shuts down any direct discussion of difficult issues, these issues metastasize into problems that end up sinking the ship.</p>

<p><strong>The </strong><em><strong>Titanic</strong></em><strong> has already struck the iceberg and is doomed, but since this upsets the passengers, we dance around the facts rather than take immediate action.</strong> Everything about the situation is upsetting, and so emotions dominate the zeitgeist: resentments, blame-game, accusations, the whole self-reinforcing dynamic leads to people shouting at others as they drown. The last word, indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Federal deficit spending and the overweighting of entitlement spending on retirees is too upsetting to discuss factually, so we don't. But the math doesn't work, and so the ship will sink.</strong> This was obvious 20 years ago, when I posted this: <a href="https://www.oftwominds.com/blogs/boomers.html">Boomers, Prepare to Fall on Your Swords</a> (June 2005), in which I suggested that well-off Boomers address the problem by gracefully making the necessary sacrifices rather than heap them on the younger generations.</p>

<p><strong>It was even more obvious by 2013, when I posted this:</strong> <a href="https://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay13/genX5-13.html">Generation X: An Inconvenient Era</a> (May 23, 2013), in which correspondent Eric A. explains how <em>the math doesn't work</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Let's start with some necessary stipulations.</strong> When I suggest well-off Boomers accept the need to make sacrifices to save the ship from sinking, I suggest this as someone in this cohort.</p>

<p>I am a Boomer, drawing my Social Security benefit, which like my lifetime income, is close to the national median SSA benefit. I'm solidly in the middle of the pack. Being over the age of 65, I also have Medicare benefits. Like many others of my generation, I've lived frugally, saved money, worked hard, etc. Since I'm still working, I pay Social Security and Medicare taxes--15.3% of all earned income as I am self-employed.</p>

<p>Unlike others in my generation, I attribute only a modest percentage of my net worth to frugality and working hard, as the majority of whatever "wealth" I own is the direct result of the hyper-financialization credit-asset bubble that's been inflated since 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Those who were able to buy assets such as houses and stocks decades ago saw their net worth rise to extraordinary heights in the bubble.</strong> Those who didn't or couldn't buy assets before the bubble did not see their net worth rise to extraordinary heights.</p>

<p><strong>Let's go over how we got here.</strong> The current federal tax system and retiree benefits evolved in the 1930s to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, retirement meant poverty for many workers who were unable to save a nestegg large enough to fund their no-earnings years. Social Security was enacted as a way of using the SSA taxes paid by current workers (1% of wages in those days) to fund a modest retirement income for retirees.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security was always a </strong><em><strong>pay as you go</strong></em><strong> system.</strong> Whatever SSA tax revenues that weren't distributed piled up in a Trust Fund. This Trust Fund was eliminated in the mid-1960s, and excess SSA taxes went into the federal general fund. The current Trust Fund is a useful fiction. When SSA runs a deficit, the Treasury funds the deficit by selling Treasury bonds, just as it does with all other deficit spending.</p>

<p><strong>Political realities demanded that the program be universal to attract widespread support.</strong> So millionaires collect Social Security and Medicare benefits, too. As SSA's financial foundations erode, a modest reform was enacted: above a modest income, 50% of SSA benefits are taxed as regular income.</p>

<p><strong>Back when the program was enacted, there were around 10 workers for every retiree.</strong> The demographics and economy were different then. The economy was mostly domestic, and the bubble of the 1920s had popped. Financialization and globalization were at low ebb. Everyone assumed there would always be 10 workers for every retiree.</p>

<p><strong>But people started living longer, the disabled were added to Social Security, and Medicare ballooned from a modest program to an open-ended spending juggernaut.</strong> In other words, the economy changed, demographics changed, but the system has not been changed to reflect these realities. SSA and Medicare taxes have increased dramatically, but these programs are still funded by payroll taxes paid by employees and employers.</p>

<p>Capital (assets, income from capital gains, speculation and investments) only pays a thin slice of Medicare via the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on capital gains incomes above $200,000 for single taxpayers and above $250,000 for couples filing jointly.</p>

<p><strong>What we're actually discussing isn't just generational; it's 1) the open-ended nature of the Medicare and Medicaid programs</strong>, 2) the impossibility of relying on two workers to pay all the benefits for each retiree as the number of retirees and beneficiaries exceeds 69 million people while the full-time workforce is 135 million, and 3) the extraordinary wealth divide in the U.S. where the majority of the wealth is held by the top few percent and the retiree generation (Boomers) for the reasons stated above.</p>

<p><strong>The solutions are as obvious as plugging a hole in the ship's hull.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>1) The tax burden has to be shifted from labor to capital via financial transaction taxes and ending the multi-trillion dollar exclusions on capital gains.</em></p>

<p><em>2) Social Security and Medicare benefits must be means tested; those collecting $10,000 a month in other pensions and investment income don't need Social Security benefits, which should be reserved for those with no other substantive source of steady income in their retirement years.</em></p>

<p><em>3) The open-ended entitlement programs must be limited in some fashion, and there is no way to do this that will not upset everyone. Hard choices--triage--must be made, as doing nothing is choosing to let the ship sink.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Let's feast on the facts of the matter.</strong> Those who need a calming agent, please do so now.</p>

<p><strong>Here's household/non-profit net worth.</strong> The household sector has a net worth of $160 trillion. Notice that the total is far above the inflation rate. This is a credit-asset bubble on steroids.</p>

<p><strong>Here is total debt.</strong> Borrow a bunch of money into existence and dump it into financial speculation, and voila, a debt-fueled asset bubble for the ages.</p>

<p><strong>Here is total public debt.</strong> Is a parabolic rise really sustainable? No, the math doesn't work, especially as interest rates rise: the debt costs nothing to service at 0%, but the interest payments are huge at 4%.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2815%29_8.jpg?itok=vBbuxe-_" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2815%29_8.jpg?itok=vBbuxe-_"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="854fe1c8-7b67-4381-883e-1c8a83f684d3" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="416" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2815%29_8.jpg?itok=vBbuxe-_" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Apologists love to attribute the debt to inflation or "growth," but that's misdirection.</strong> As a percentage of the nation's GDP (gross domestic product), the debt has risen 4-fold since president Reagan shepherded Social Security reforms in the early 1980s, and doubled as a percentage of GDP since 2007, before the Federal Reserve bailed out the status quo with hyper-financialization.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2816%29_6.jpg?itok=Vo6fZPPj" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2816%29_6.jpg?itok=Vo6fZPPj"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="259b05a6-8fd4-4613-a556-793a341279d2" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="415" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2816%29_6.jpg?itok=Vo6fZPPj" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Here is a pie chart of federal spending.</strong> Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are 44%. Toss in the other mandatory spending--a big chunk of which is interest paid on federal debt--and there's not much left to cut. The reality is there is no way to slow the runaway debt train without tackling open-ended retirement / healthcare programs.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2817%29_7.jpg?itok=vyRO9vFW" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2817%29_7.jpg?itok=vyRO9vFW"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="38d2bfd4-5d4f-4745-baf8-1d7c09a2431c" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="351" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2817%29_7.jpg?itok=vyRO9vFW" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>The vast majority of projected growth in federal spending stems from these programs and the interest paid on funds borrowed to fund them.</strong> Unfortunately, these facts don't disappear because we don't like them.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2818%29_7.jpg?itok=yd97UcYD" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2818%29_7.jpg?itok=yd97UcYD"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8fa2544d-df9c-4333-9c41-d24c7c5d82b8" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="375" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2818%29_7.jpg?itok=yd97UcYD" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Boomers hold the majority of net worth.</strong> So it follows that increasing taxes on capital will impact the Boomers who are wealthy--and younger folks who are wealthy, too, of course.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2819%29_7.jpg?itok=1BbviyzM" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2819%29_7.jpg?itok=1BbviyzM"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="55dc2351-99fc-4c0f-b862-4bb394261125" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2819%29_7.jpg?itok=1BbviyzM" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>It's interesting how debt and the net worth of the top 1% have soared in tandem.</strong> Could it be that soaring debt-asset bubbles have benefited the top 1% far more than the debt bubble has benefited the bottom 50%? And if that's the case, then what does this suggest in terms of saving the ship from sinking?</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2820%29_7.jpg?itok=ID1Lkq5C" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2820%29_7.jpg?itok=ID1Lkq5C"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5b99954b-2257-48eb-80a0-e500fb8cd58c" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="313" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2820%29_7.jpg?itok=ID1Lkq5C" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>The passengers on the </strong><em><strong>Titanic</strong></em><strong> arguing with each other can't stop the ship from sinking by "winning the argument."</strong> Silencing those willing to discuss the issues factually doesn't actually make the factual realities go away.</p>

<p><strong>Those of us who run businesses / are self-employed don't have the luxury of not dealing with financial realities. Triage comes with every enterprise.</strong> We need a national discussion of triage that doesn't immediately degrade into denial or histrionics. And no, AI and stablecoins aren't going to make all this go away, any more than hoping the Central Bank of Mars will emerge to give us a 36 trillion-quatloo bailout.</p>

<p><strong>Boomers--and Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z--let's face it: the math doesn't work.</strong> Triage means sacrifices will have to be made and distributed to those most able to afford them to spare those least able to afford them. The ship is not just taking on water; it's loaded with <em>third rails</em> and sacred cows that can't be touched, and so it's doomed to sink if we do nothing.</p>

<p><strong>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve COVID-19 vaccines for many Americans absent trial data showing that the benefits outweigh the risks</strong>, top agency officials said on May 20.</p>

<p>“Moving forward, <strong>the FDA will adopt the following Covid-19 vaccination regulatory framework: On the basis of immunogenicity—proof that a vaccine can generate antibody titers in people</strong>—the FDA anticipates that it will be able to make favorable benefit–risk findings for adults over the age of 65 years and for all persons above the age of 6 months with one or more risk factors that put them at high risk for severe Covid-19 outcomes,” such as asthma or cancer, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929">wrote</a> in a New England Journal of Medicine article.</p>

<p>“For all healthy persons—those with no risk factors for severe Covid-19—between the ages of 6 months and 64 years<strong>, the FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data evaluating clinical outcomes before Biologics License Applications can be granted.</strong>”</p>

<p>Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax, which have received licenses for their COVID-19 vaccines, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Several medical groups that have commented on FDA steps concerning COVID-19 vaccines, such as the American Academy of Family Physicians, did not return inquiries.</p>

<p>The FDA in 2024, in its most recent action concerning the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-approves-new-covid-19-vaccines-5710997">approved</a> updated versions for most Americans and extended emergency authorization for others, despite there being no trial data available for those formulations.</p>

<p><strong>The regulatory agency on May 16<a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-approves-new-covid-19-vaccine-with-restrictions-5859587"> approved</a> Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine for the first time</strong>. The approval was for adults aged 65 and up. The agency said that people aged 12 to 64 could receive a Novavax shot, but only if they have one of the conditions that puts them at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.</p>

<p>An earlier version of Novavax’s shot was tested in a randomized, controlled trial in 2021.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people aged 6 months and older receive one of the latest COVID-19 vaccines, but just 13 percent of children and 23 percent of adults have followed that recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Makary and Prasad noted that a number of other countries, such as Australia and Germany, only recommend COVID-19 vaccines to certain populations.</strong></p>

<p>“While all other high-income nations confine vaccine recommendations to older adults (typically those older than 65 years of age), or those at high risk for severe Covid-19, the United States has adopted a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework and has granted broad marketing authorization to all Americans over the age of 6 months,” they wrote on Tuesday. “The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view.”</p>

<p><strong>The officials said that while the quick development of COVID-19 vaccines was a scientific and medical achievement, the benefit of repeated dosing—some people have received at least six doses—is unclear.</strong></p>

<p>The trials of the vaccines should measure prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, with secondary endpoints including severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death, according to Makary and Prasad, who said that the trials should include participants who contracted COVID-19 within the past year, and they should follow participants for at least six months “to ensure that early booster gains persist.” The control group could receive a saline placebo, the officials said.</p>

<p>“<strong>Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based</strong>,” they wrote.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/hhs-to-require-placebo-controlled-trials-for-new-vaccines-5850077">pledged</a> to require placebo-controlled trials for new vaccines.</p>

<p>Makary and Prasad planned to talk about the policy update<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jbRGlEsbKQ4"> at 1 p.m.</a> on Tuesday.</p>

Title: "Today I Will Show My Naked Body": Rep. Nancy Mace Combats Voyeurism During Oversight Hearing
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">"Today I Will Show My Naked Body": Rep. Nancy Mace Combats Voyeurism During Oversight Hearing</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) <strong>showed 'photos of her naked body' during a House Oversight meeting on Tuesday </strong>as the latest twist in her crusade against voyeurism.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/6f483ee9_jpg_92.jpg?itok=vhcIH-Pi" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/6f483ee9_jpg_92.jpg?itok=vhcIH-Pi"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="44ff159b-6377-496c-b718-aeb398aa2ade" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/6f483ee9_jpg_92.jpg?itok=vhcIH-Pi" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Mace was engaged to Charleston-based software entrepreneur, Patrick Bryant. After purchasing two properties together, their relationship ended abruptly in 2021 after Mace reportedly discovered Bryant on a dating app.</p>

<p><strong>Mace would later claim</strong> in a <a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2025/02/28/attorneys-for-1-of-the-men-accused-by-mace-demand-evidence-or-an-apology/">February speech</a> on the House floor that in November 2023, she discovered a digital cache of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/patrick-bryant-nancy-mace-accusations-b2696289.html">over 10,000 videos and photos</a> on Bryant’s phone, depicting rape, nonconsensual photos, and videos of women and underage girls, including herself. </p>

<p>She recounted finding a video of herself naked, unaware she was being filmed, and alleged that Bryant recorded her without consent - and claims that Bryant and several other men conspired to commit <strong>sexual exploitation, voyeurism, and assault </strong>targeting multiple women, including minors, for over two decades.</p>

<p>She also says she found evidence of an app storing files from <strong>a hidden camera - </strong>with one alone containing <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/congresswoman-nancy-mace-house-speech-south-carolina/article_4b162376-e7c7-11ef-8169-2799c722a7b6.html">10,633 videos</a>.</p>

<h2>Rape, Drugging and Sex Trafficking</h2>

<p>Mace alleged that in 2022, while at a property co-owned by Bryant and another accused man, she consumed two vodka sodas, blacked out, and was raped, though she could not confirm if Bryant was the perpetrator - but that Bryant and his associates drugged her and other women, suggesting the incidents might have been filmed or sold on the dark web.</p>

<p>She also accused the men of <a href="https://people.com/nancy-mace-accuses-ex-fiance-patrick-bryant-others-rape-8789748">sex trafficking</a>, alleging they paid each other to abuse women, which she described as a “premeditated, calculated exploitation.”</p>

<p>Bryant, a co-founder of the software firm Code/+/Trust and former chairman of the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce, categorically denied all allegations.</p>

Title: US Attorney's New Program Sidesteps California's Sanctuary Laws Shielding Illegals From ICE
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">US Attorney's New Program Sidesteps California's Sanctuary Laws Shielding Illegals From ICE</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/us-attorneys-new-program-gets-around-californias-sanctuary-laws-shielding-illegal-immigrants-from-ice-5860259?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge"><em>Authored by Darlene McCormick Sanchez via The Epoch Times,</em></a></p>

<p>In what could be a game changer for the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for California’s Central District and federal partners launched a program to “neutralize California’s sanctuary state policy.”</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2819%29_8.jpg?itok=TwR0bKt7" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2819%29_8.jpg?itok=TwR0bKt7"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="54eb1a7d-3d94-40bd-aa39-476ceb81051c" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2819%29_8.jpg?itok=TwR0bKt7" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Operation Guardian Angel, announced by federal officials on May 19, will file complaints and arrest warrants to allow federal authorities to take as many defendants as possible into custody from county jails, according to a Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/operation-guardian-angel-launched-neutralize-californias-sanctuary-state-policies">press release</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“Under the Trump administration, we will not allow sanctuary jurisdictions to stand in the way of keeping the American People safe,”</strong> U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who launched the test program, <a href="https://x.com/USAttyEssayli/status/1924550658369438170">posted</a> on X.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of President Donald Trump’s main campaign promises for a second term was the mass deportation of millions who came into the country illegally during the Biden administration.</p>

<p><strong>If a person who has been deported reenters the country illegally, that’s a felony under Title 8 law, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles.</strong></p>

<p>California’s state law—<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54">Senate Bill 54</a>—prevents county sheriff’s departments and local law enforcement from honoring an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Even if they want to turn them over, they can’t,” McEvoy told The Epoch Times.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Operation Guardian Angel gets around the law through federal arrest warrants, which McEvoy said leave the counties no choice but to hand the targeted illegal immigrants over.</strong></p>

<p>Essayli stated in the press release that “the worst criminal aliens in state custody are frequently released into the community” because California’s sanctuary state policies block cooperation with federal law enforcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“These laws effectively render federal immigration detainers meaningless. The days of giving criminal illegal aliens a free pass are over,”</strong></em> he stated.</p>

<p><em><strong>“While California may be presently disregarding detainers, it cannot ignore federal arrest warrants.”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The program, which began May 10, has resulted in the arrest of 13 defendants as of May 15 in California. The Operation Guardian Angel task force is made up of ICE, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

<p>The California federal district is home to the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles County. An estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants reside in the district, including gang members, the press release said, adding that California’s protection of criminal illegal aliens makes residents less safe.</p>

<p>The release noted that in February 2025, José Cristian Saravia-Sánchez, 30, of Mexico, shot and killed an Inglewood man who tried to stop him from stealing a catalytic converter, which garnered national attention.</p>

<p>He was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of vehicle theft, removed from the United States in 2013, and arrested 11 times between June 2022 and August 2024, according to the release. However, local law enforcement was prevented by state law from complying with an immigration detainer request, the release stated.</p>

<p>The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times by publication time.</p>

Title: Rubio Says Syria Could Be 'Weeks Away' From Civil War, State Collapse (Again)
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Rubio Says Syria Could Be 'Weeks Away' From Civil War, State Collapse (Again)</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last Thursday met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani and other ruling Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) officials in Antalya, Turkey - just as President Trump controversially greeted Syria's new ruler Ahmed al-Sharaa (Jolani) in Riyadh. Rubio's was the first such US meeting with a Syrian foreign minister in fifteen years, the State Department later said.</p>

<p>Following this, Rubio on Tuesday went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to defend the administration's dropping of all Syria sanctions, in order to "give them a chance" - as Trump said of Syria while on his Gulf visit. Rubio sounded an alarm, warning that the already war-torn country <strong>could be weeks away from civil war </strong>and <strong>collapse</strong> of the HTS government. Watch:</p>

There have for weeks been running street battles between HTS and Druze factions in the south and in suburbs of Damascus.</p>

<p>Describing the rationale behind dropping the years-long brutal US sanctions, Rubio said: "We want to help that government succeed, because the alternative is full-scale civil war and chaos, <strong>which would, of course, destabilize the entire region</strong>."</p>

<p>Of course, the supreme and dark irony here is that it was Washington which led destabilization efforts in Syria over the last decade in the first place, with the CIA's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html">Operation Timber Sycamore</a>. Assad fled the country on December 8, and since then the brutal Islamist group HTS and US-designated terrorist Sharaa/Jolani has ruled from Damascus.</p>

<p>Rubio actually said before the senators that <strong>"When Syria is unstable, the region becomes unstable."</strong></p>

<p>But, he continued, "If we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we did not engage them, it was guaranteed to not work out."</p>

Title: US Shale Output Nearing Peak As Oil Prices Stagnate
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">US Shale Output Nearing Peak As Oil Prices Stagnate</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Shale-Output-Nearing-Peak-as-Oil-Prices-Stagnate.html"><em>Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via OilPrice.com,</em></a></p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Low oil prices and economic uncertainty are causing U.S. oil production, particularly in shale basins, to plateau or decline earlier than anticipated.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Major oil companies acknowledge the accelerated peak in U.S. oil output, with the Permian Basin being the last major area still showing growth potential.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Forecasts for U.S. crude supply are being revised downward as the profitability of shale production is challenged by current oil prices.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>The decline in oil prices and the prevailing uncertainty about the economy, trade, and supply chains are accelerating the peak in U.S. oil production despite President Donald Trump’s<strong> ‘drill, baby, drill’ </strong>slogan.  </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-16_dqnyjhsqgw.jpg?itok=p4Fi5xzK" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-16_dqnyjhsqgw.jpg?itok=p4Fi5xzK"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a714c979-5485-48c2-a4e0-322bee471c0a" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="209" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-16_dqnyjhsqgw.jpg?itok=p4Fi5xzK" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>With the U.S. benchmark <a href="https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/#WTI-Crude">WTI crude prices</a> at $60 per barrel, it’s mostly “hold, baby, hold” in the American shale patch, where output in the major basins except the Permian has already started to level off or drop. </strong></p>

<p>The U.S.-China 90-day tariff pause and the start of trade talks did little to erase the crash in oil prices from April, and even less to restore confidence or wipe out the high uncertainty regarding the economy and the cost of supply with unknown levels of tariffs. The shale patch has historically been immediately responsive to changing market conditions, but living in 90-day cycles of tariffs, no-tariffs, reduced tariffs, or surprise U.S. geopolitical moves could be too much for the oil industry, especially the smaller companies. </p>

<p>The big ones, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Occidental, and ConocoPhillips, aren’t voicing publicly concerns about doing business and doing it as usual at $60 oil. But some of them have already said that the peak in U.S. oil production is being accelerated and could be sooner than previously expected. </p>

<p>The peak, whenever it occurs, does not mean a steep decline afterwards—it would rather be a long plateau of leveling off of U.S. crude oil production in which the slowdown in shale would be partly offset by rising output from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, executives and analysts say.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“As you know that most of the shale basins now have either plateaued or starting to decline, except for the Permian,” </strong></em>Vicki Hollub, President and CEO of Occidental Petroleum, <a href="https://www.oxy.com/siteassets/documents/investors/quarterly-earnings/oxy1q25transcript.pdf">said</a> on the Q1 earnings call. </p>

<p><em>“If companies continue to talk about dropping activity levels, I think the Permian could plateau sooner than we expected - and we had expected the Permian to continue growth through 2027,” Hollub added. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxy had expected that U.S. production overall would peak between 2027 and 2030. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“It's looking like with the current headwinds or at least volatility and uncertainty around pricing and the economy and recessions and all of that - it's looking like that peak could come sooner,”</strong></em> Hollub said, adding that the Permian would grow very little this year, if at all.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ryan Lance, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, <a href="https://static.conocophillips.com/files/resources/cop-usq_transcript_2025-05-08.pdf">said</a> on the company’s earnings call that at $60 oil, “the folks that don't have the kind of cost of supply sitting in their portfolio are going to find themselves cash-strapped and returns-strapped.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“Obviously, the balance sheets are in pretty good shape across the industry, better than we were in the last downturn, but you'll see a lot of activity cut back,”</strong></em> Lance added. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At current prices, ConocoPhillips doesn’t expect a lot of things to change for the company, although there would be changes if WTI sinks to $50 per barrel. However, “that's not our view today and doesn't represent where we think the market is going to be for the next few years,” Lance noted. </p>

<p>The current mantra at ConocoPhillips is “don't whipsaw this thing too hard right now…so don't overreact, but don't put your head in the sand either.” </p>

<p><strong>Earlier this month, Diamondback Energy said onshore oil production in the U.S. <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Shale-Major-Sees-US-Oil-Production-Peaking.html">has already peaked</a>. </strong></p>

<p>“We currently estimate that the U.S. frac crew count is already down ~15% this year, with the Permian Basin crew count down ~20% from its January peak, and both are expected to decline further,” Diamondback said in a <a href="https://www.diamondbackenergy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-stockholders-issued-diamondback-energy-inc-7">letter</a> to investors. </p>

<p>Liberty Energy, the fracking company founded by now-Energy Secretary Chris Wright, is also prepping for a <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Fracking-Company-Forecasts-Major-Shale-Slowdown.html">slowdown in shale drilling</a>.  </p>

<p>U.S. crude oil supply will rise more slowly than expected for the rest of 2025 and in 2026 and <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Crude-Oil-Output-to-Peak-Sooner-Than-Expected.html">peak as early as this year</a>, as WTI prices at $60 per barrel are testing the breakeven point of shale production, energy flows intelligence firm Kpler said last week. </p>

<p><strong>With the low oil prices, Kpler <a href="https://x.com/Kpler/status/1919355178756559254">has now cut</a> its U.S. crude supply forecast by 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 170,000 bpd for the rest of 2025 and into 2026, “as weaker prices threaten to slow shale production.”  </strong></p>

<p>Despite steady near-term activity, growth is slowing in the U.S. shale patch, and U.S. crude output is set to peak this year, Kpler noted. </p>

Title: The Red Line: Democratic Officials Claim A Dangerous License For Illegality
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The Red Line: Democratic Officials Claim A Dangerous License For Illegality</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/05/20/the-red-line-democratic-officials-claim-a-license-for-illegality/"><em>Authored by Jonathan Turley,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Across the country, a new defense is being heard in state and federal courtrooms. </strong>From Democratic members of Congress to judges to city council members, officials claim that their official duties include obstructing the official functions of the federal government. </p>

<p>It is <strong>a type of liberal license that excuses most any crime in the name of combating what Minn. Gov. Tim Walz called the “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5307956-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-gestapo-trump/">modern-day Gestapo</a>”</strong> of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/images%20%283%29_15.jpg?itok=dH3leeO6" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/images%20%283%29_15.jpg?itok=dH3leeO6"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="79547ee7-7211-46de-adda-0dfb3c7b7164" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="335" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/images%20%283%29_15.jpg?itok=dH3leeO6" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The latest claimant of this license is Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who was charged with assaulting, resisting, and impeding law enforcement officers during a protest at Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. McIver is shown on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqIDzHUixco">video</a> forcing her way into an ICE facility and striking and shoving agents in her path.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqIDzHUixco" title="DHS Releases Video Of Rep. McIver At Delaney Hall Detention Center—Now She Is Being Charged By DOJ" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p><strong>This was not a major incursion, but these state and federal officials joined a mob in briefly overwhelming security and breaching the fence barrier after a bus was allowed through the entrance. </strong>Federal officials were able to quickly force back the incursion.</p>

<p>McIver and House Democrats insisted that McIver’s forcing her way into the facility might be trespass and assault for other citizens, but she was merely exercising “legislative oversight.” Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) <a href="https://www.aol.com/border-czar-homan-shrugs-off-230503183.html">declared</a> “You lay a finger on someone – on Bonnie Watson Coleman or any of the representatives that were there – you lay a finger on them, we’re going to have a problem.”</p>

<p><strong>Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) even ominously warned the federal government that Democrats would bring down the house if it tried to charge McIver: “It’s a red line. They know better than to go down that road.”</strong></p>

<p>Well, the red line was crossed in a big way after Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba charged McIver with a felony under Title 18, United States Code, Section 111(a)(1).</p>

<p><strong>The ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-and-aclu-of-new-jersey-react-to-trump-administrations-charges-against-congresswoman-mciver">called</a> the charged “authoritarianism” and insisted that these state and federal politicians “have every right to exercise their legally authorized oversight responsibilities for expanded immigration detention in New Jersey.”</strong></p>

<p>The problem with the oversight claim is that McIver’s status as a member of Congress does not allow her access into closed federal facilities. Congress can subpoena the Executive Branch or secure court orders for access. However, member do not have immunity from criminal laws in unilaterally forcing their way into any federal office or agency.</p>

<p>If that were the case, Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez would not have posted images of herself <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450315-photographer-shares-photos-of-ocasio-cortez-at-border-after-concentration-camp/">crying at the fence</a> of an immigrant facility, she could have climbed over the fence in the name of oversight.</p>

<p>Conversely, Republicans in the Biden Administration could have simply pushed their way into the Justice Department to seek the files on the influence-peddling scandal.</p>

<p><strong>Yet, the point of the claim is less of a real criminal defense and more of a political excuse.</strong></p>

<p>It is the same claim being heard this week from Worcester City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj who was shown in a <a href="https://whdh.com/news/worcester-police-release-bodycam-footage-of-ice-arrest/">video shoving</a> and obstructing ICE officers attempting to arrest a woman on immigration charges. Two other individuals (including a Democratic candidate for a school board) were arrested, but not Haxhiaj who claimed that she was merely protecting “a constituent.” After the melee, the city manager issued an order preventing city police from assisting in any way in the carrying out of such civil immigration enforcement efforts by the federal government.</p>

<p><strong>Even judges are claiming the same license.</strong> </p>

<p>In Wisconsin, Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstructing a federal arrest of an illegal immigrant who appeared in her courtroom. Dugan heard about agents waiting outside in the hallway to arrest the man and went outside to confront the agents. She told them to speak to the Chief Judge and that they needed a different warrant.</p>

<p><strong>The agents complied and the Chief Judge confirmed that they could conduct the arrest. In the interim, however, Dugan led the man out a non-public door and facilitated his escape (he was arrested after a chase down a public street).</strong></p>

<p>Judge Duggan also claimed that she was carrying out her duties even though her hearing was over, the charges were not part of state matter, and the arrest was being carried out outside of her courtroom.</p>

<p>As Democratic leaders like Walz engage in rage rhetoric and paint Republicans (and federal law enforcement) as Nazis, political violence across the country. Many of the people burning Teslas and engaging in such crimes claim the same type of license that the ends justify the means. That includes affluent professionals who are now <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/04/07/the-american-jacobin-how-some-on-the-left-have-found-release-in-an-age-of-rage/">shoplifting from Whole Foods</a> as a “protest” against Jeff Bezos meeting with Trump.</p>

<p>When the Administration sought to investigate those burning Teslas and dealerships, Rep. Dan Goldman (D., N.Y.) <a href="https://jonathanturley.org/2025/03/27/rep-goldman-the-fbi-investigation-of-tesla-attacks-is-political-weaponization/">denounced</a> it as a “political weaponization” of the legal system. The comments suggest that such arson is somehow a form of political expression on the left.</p>

<p><strong>House Minority Leader Jeffries was correct that a “red line” was crossed but not the one that he was thinking of in threatening consequences for any charges. The red line is the one separating political expression and criminal conduct.</strong></p>

<p>Border Czar stressed repeatedly to political leaders that they can protest and refuse to help but “you can‘t cross the line” into obstruction and interference with their operations.</p>

<p>If oversight means that members can force their way into any federal facilities, we would have 535 roaming inspectors general who could wander at will through the executive branch.</p>

<p><strong>Rep. McIver would be better to claim a different type of oversight, in allowing her passion to briefly overwhelm her judgment in rushing into the facility.</strong></p>

<p>In the end, however, McIver and Duggan may have a license of a different kind.</p>

<p><strong>Both have an advantage of being charged in liberal districts where they would appear before sympathetic jurors.</strong>  They need to just convince a single jury to engage in “jury nullification,” to vote based on the cause, not the crime, in the case.</p>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>President Trump following Monday's <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/trump-speak-putin-zelensky-monday-toward-ending-ukraine-bloodbath">phone calls</a> with Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said that the United States <strong>should have never intervened in Ukraine</strong> in the first place.</p>

<p>He blasted his predecessor Joe Biden for sinking boundless billions in arms and aid into Kiev's coffers and yet it has only been a "death trap" and "real mess" which US decision-makers should have avoided altogether. "<strong>This is not my war. We got ourselves entangled in something we shouldn't have been involved in, and we would have been a lot better off. It's a real mess. It's a death trap</strong>," he said before reporters Monday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>"I do have a certain line, but I don't want to say what that line is because I think it makes the negotiation even more difficult than it is</strong>," Trump asserted. When pressed, he refrained from divulging what precisely that red line is in the press briefing.</p>

<p>Trump also addressed the ever-present potential for the US to get drawn in deeper, which is why he said this should be Europe's mess and responsibility, and not the United States'.</p>

<p>"We don’t have boots on the ground, we wouldn’t have boots on the ground. But we do have a big stake. The financial amount that was put up is just crazy," he added.</p>

<p>"Again,<strong> this was a European situation</strong>. It should have remained a European situation. But we got involved – much more than Europe did – because the past administration felt very strongly that we should," he said. <strong>"We gave massive amounts, I think record-setting amounts, both weaponry and money."</strong></p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Meanwhile, in the wake of the Trump-Putin call, which lasted over two hours, <strong>the mainstream media has been slamming the US president as essentially giving Putin a free hand</strong>. President Trump had said it went "very well" and that he seems "an imminent end to the war".</p>

<p>For example, below is The Washington Post's perspective in a fresh <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/20/trump-putin-call-ukraine-europe/">Tuesday report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDZF2G6ZQFE6HEQVYIGOGUT3FQ" data-el="text" dir="null"><em>A phone call between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin <strong>shut down an effort to pressure Russia into an immediate ceasefire</strong> and instead opened the way for continued fighting while lengthy negotiations take place — much to the consternation of Ukraine and its European allies Tuesday.</em></p>

<p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63JY6EMDWRFXLHNIBNIM5D4OAE" data-el="text" dir="null"><em><strong>Trump’s abandonment of new sanctions on Russian indicated that he may be stepping away from involvement in the talks</strong>, something that his team has been flagging for weeks. Trump said Monday that the conditions for a ceasefire could only be agreed by the warring parties “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.”</em></p>

<p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XNNLWU3Y5E5VMRELINVXN4PWY" data-el="text" dir="null"><em><strong>European leaders say they had originally been planning with U.S. officials to levy new sanctions on Russia if it did not declare an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet the reality is that the sanctions themselves would certainly escalate the conflict and proxy war further, providing even less of an opportunity for a diplomatic off-ramp, and Trump knows this.</p>

<p>Trump had written just after the call: "Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.</p>

<p><em>Growing impatience on all sides, even among Trump supporters and conservatives, amid fears that the proxy war could just continue endlessly...</em></p>

<p>A recent data breach at crypto exchange Coinbase has raised concerns about user safety after hackers gained access to sensitive information, including home addresses.</p>

<p>Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cyber-criminals-steal-coinbase-customer-data-20-m-ransom">exchange up to $400 million</a> in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.</p>

<p>However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.</p>

<p><strong>“Very disappointed in Coinbase right now.</strong> Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X <a href="https://x.com/arrington/status/1924587249674412266">post</a>, adding:</p>

<blockquote><strong>“Something that has to be said though - this hack - which includes home addresses and account balances - will lead to people dying. It probably has already.</strong>”</blockquote>

<p>While no passwords, private keys or account funds were exposed, cybercriminals reportedly bribed overseas customer service contractors to access internal systems. This allowed them to steal personal data that could be used in social engineering scams or even physical extortion attempts.</p>

<p><strong>With Bitcoin trading above $100,000, crypto wealth has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/100k-bitcoin-impacts-wealth-gap-digital-age">become a growing target for criminals</a>.</strong> Experts warn that leaked address data could expose high-net-worth individuals to real-world risks.</p>

<p>On May 16, Cointelegraph reported on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors">six violent robberies</a> that targeted cryptocurrency investors, aiming to extort digital assets via kidnapping or torture.</p>

<p>In a ruthless attack on May 4, the father of a French crypto entrepreneur was <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/04/europe/crypto-entrepreneur-finger-severed-intl-latam">abducted</a> in Paris, France. The kidnappers cut the victim’s finger and sent a video to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto.</p>

<p>The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/04/europe/crypto-entrepreneur-finger-severed-intl-latam">arrested</a> in connection with the kidnapping.</p>

<h2>Crypto exchanges need “layered” cybersecurity</h2>

<p>To prevent similar user data breaches, crypto exchanges need to adopt a “layered defense strategy,” according to Ronghui Gu, the co-founder of CertiK Web3 security firm.</p>

<p>“This can include privileged access management, zero trust architecture, multifactor authentication across internal systems, and continuous monitoring with behavioral analytics,” Gu told Cointelegraph, adding: </p>

<blockquote><em><strong>“Preventive measures such as regular phishing simulations, tailored security training, and restricting third-party access to sensitive systems may help reduce these risks.”</strong></em></blockquote>

<p>However, crypto platforms will need to “rethink their security posture” as attackers “increasingly target human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones,” added Gu, warning of the rising threat of social engineering schemes.</p>

Title:  “就像船即将触礁，但掌舵人却在争论该往哪个方向转弯”，投资者质疑特朗普减税法案加剧债务 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">美债市场正处于暴风雨前夜，特朗普政府推进的巨额减税法案恐将成为压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美国国会委员会在周日通过的预算法案将预计将在未来十年增加数万亿美元的联邦赤字。这项法案和信用评级下调加剧了人们对美国公共财政可持续性的担忧，而许多投资者和分析师表示，美国的债务和赤字已经处于令人不安的高水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在接受媒体采访时，桥水基金亿万富翁创始人达利欧（Ray Dalio）对此表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“这就像一艘船即将触礁，而掌舵人却在争论该往哪个方向转弯。我不太关心他们是向左转还是向右转，我更关心的是他们能否让船回到正确的航道上。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">税改法案引爆恐慌，“债市义警”准备就绪</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">据悉，这项税改方案将延长特朗普在其第一个任期内通过的大规模减税政策，还计划大幅削减针对低收入人群的医疗保险计划和食品援助计划。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">白宫新闻秘书Karoline Leavitt周一表示，该法案“不会增加赤字”，呼应了特朗普政府其他官员的说法，即减税将加速经济增长。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，据无党派组织Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget估计，该立法将使公共债务到2034年底增加至少3.3万亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">该组织表示，<strong>这还将使债务占GDP比率从当前的100%增至创纪录的125%，远超现行法律下预测的同期117%的水平；年度赤字将从2024年约6.4%的GDP比例升至6.9%。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在众议院预算委员会推进该立法以及穆迪下调美国评级之后，30年期美债收益率周一飙升至5.04%的峰值，创下2023年以来的最高水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Garda Capital Partners首席投资官Tim Magnusson表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“我们正处于国债市场的一个转折点，为了让国债维持在当前水平，我们需要尽快获得有关赤字的好消息。如果需要有人来约束，那将是债券市场。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yardeni Research总裁Edward Yardeni指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“债市义警已经准备就绪，他们准备采取行动了。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">全球资本开始对美国失去信心</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>财政担忧和关税政策的不确定性使投资者更加关注他们对美元资产的敞口。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">DoubleLine投资集团的投资组合经理Bill Campbell指出，该公司对20年期和30年期美国国债“低配”，认为该国“看起来没有认真努力控制债务的迹象”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">德意志银行的George Saravelos表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“对美国资产的购买意愿下降以及美国财政程序难以控制高赤字，是造成市场高度紧张的原因。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">在达利欧看来，美国需要迅速通过某种组合方式将赤字削减至GDP的3%，包括减少支出、增加收入和降低实际借贷成本。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">随着美国国会继续推进特朗普的减税政策，美国公共财政的未来前景变得愈加黯淡，投资者可能很快就要为美国政府的“放纵”付出代价。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  继美国之后，欧洲也对小额包裹“加税” 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">据媒体报道，欧盟计划对进入该地区的数十亿件小包裹征收每件2欧元的统一费用（“flat fee”）。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">欧盟贸易事务专员塞夫乔维奇（Maros Sefcovic）于周二向欧盟提议征收这项费用，以抵消每年46亿件直接寄往居民家中的包裹产生的相关成本。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">欧盟委员会草案显示，<strong>2欧元费用将适用于寄给消费者的商品，而发往仓库的包裹将按每件0.5欧元征收费用。</strong>媒体数据显示，去年有超10亿件包裹通过欧盟主要物流枢纽荷兰和比利时入境。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据悉，这项提议旨在帮助欧盟应对大量廉价商品涌入所带来的挑战，被视为欧盟加强海关管理、保护本地产业与消费者安全的重要举措。塞夫乔维奇宣称，汹涌的包裹潮给欧盟带来了监管、安全等方面的新挑战。他表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">我不认为这是税收，这只是…对成本的补偿，应该由平台支付。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">这一举措与美国采取的类似措施相呼应。据央视财经报道，从5月2日起，美国取消对中国小额包裹免税政策正式生效，所有价值不超过800美元的小额包裹都要被征收关税。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">当前，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">日本也考虑对进口小额包裹征税</a>。据媒体报道，日本财务部正在考虑对包括小额包裹的免税政策进行审查。按照日本税制改革计划，预计2026年将制定出详细的税收新政策，在此之前，进口免税政策将继续推行。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  为了跟AI搜索竞争，谷歌越来越像Perplexity？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">谷歌正式推出“AI模式”功能，彻底重塑搜索引擎，正面迎战Perplexity、ChatGPT等AI对手的威胁。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月21日，据报道，谷歌正在搜索页面上推出一项名为“AI模式”的功能，该功能以聊天机器人风格的对话方式回答搜索查询，而不再显示传统的蓝色链接。这一选项已作为搜索页面内的标签向美国用户开放。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">谷歌母公司Alphabet的首席执行官Sundar Pichai表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#34;这是对搜索的完全重新构想，具有更先进的推理能力。我们现在正进入AI平台转变的新阶段，数十年的研究正在成为现实。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">这一变化标志着谷歌正在积极应对Perplexity、OpenAI等人工智能初创企业对其标志性的搜索引擎产品和最大收入来源的威胁。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">AI搜索颠覆传统模式，谷歌市场份额受威胁</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">人工智能聊天机器人正从根本上改变用户搜索信息的方式。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在回应查询时，OpenAI的ChatGPT及其竞争对手会以对话形式聚合信息。用户不像使用谷歌搜索时那样频繁点击多个链接。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">谷歌曾执行全球高达90%的互联网搜索。如果用户转向AI驱动的替代方案，它可能会失去流量——以及由此带来的广告收入。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，本月早些时候，在针对谷歌的联邦反垄断案中，苹果高管称，未来一年内可能会在Safari浏览器中提供ChatGPT或Perplexity等AI选项，这一消息导致Alphabet股价大幅下滑。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">谷歌的反击战略，全力押注AI</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">为了在AI竞赛中领先，谷歌一直在改进其自身AI模型和聊天机器人Gemini的能力，并将AI功能添加到许多产品中。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">去年，谷歌在搜索中引入了&#34;AI概览&#34;，该功能使用AI总结传统搜索结果，通常显示在结果页面的顶部。据谷歌表示，该功能现在拥有15亿月活跃用户。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">近几个月来，谷歌一直在试验&#34;AI模式&#34;。该功能提供类似于使用其他AI聊天机器人的搜索体验。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在新的推出计划中，使用谷歌搜索的人可以点击标签开启&#34;AI模式&#34;，该功能将由Gemini提供支持。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">谷歌搜索产品副总裁Robby Stein表示，公司正在考虑如何在“AI模式”结果中加入广告。他说，&#34;我们将其视为人们实际想要的内容组合的一部分。&#34;</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  从投行到交易员，华尔街已准备好：10年美债收益率冲击5% 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">随着特朗普税改法案引发美国债务和赤字担忧升级，交易员正大举押注10年期美债收益率将飙至5%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据彭博报道，交易员正大规模押注长期美债收益率将因美国政府不断膨胀的债务和赤字担忧而飙升，而特朗普的减税法案使这一局面变得更加危险。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报道称，包括高盛和摩根大通在内的华尔街策略师正在上调他们的收益率预测。其中，押注10年期美债收益率将达到5%的头寸规模最大。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>CME的未平仓合约数据显示，市场出现了大规模押注十年期美债收益率在未来几周内攀升至5%的期权交易，金额规模高达1100万美元。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">评级下调引发恐慌，30年期美债收益率触及5%关口</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">周一，30年期美债收益率短暂突破5%，达到自2023年11月以来的最高水平，随后回落。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这一抛售潮是由穆迪将美国信用评级从Aaa下调至Aa1引发的，这导致各期限美债收益率在周一早盘交易中全线走高，之后回落抹平涨幅。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通的策略师Jay Barry和Jason Hunter在一份报告中写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“考虑到贸易和货币政策的不确定性，以及需求格局的结构性转变，短期内风险偏向于熊市陡峭化。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据报告，<strong>对冲长期美债曲线末端可能出现的更大损失的期权金额目前已升至4月以来最高水平，</strong>当时市场正被特朗普激进贸易政策可能带来的经济影响所动摇。当前期权偏斜的走势意味着，交易员正推高看跌期权的价格，以对冲收益率飙升的风险。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">投资者快速转向空头阵营，期权市场异动频现</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">周二发布的摩根大通美债客户调查也强调了对更高债券收益率的预期。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告显示，<strong>美债看空头寸攀升至2月10日以来的最高水平。</strong>然而，由于投资者仓位比4月初更为中性，策略师预计“波动幅度将明显小于上个月”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">最近几周，针对收益率上升进行对冲的期权流动趋势已经形成，这反映在所谓的“期权偏斜”中，即显示期权价格上升以反映债券市场的抛售。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>交易员正支付越来越多的费用来对冲曲线长端的抛售，</strong>与周一美国30年期国债收益率突破5%水平以及最近美国国债收益率曲线陡峭化的走势相符。长期债券合约中看跌期权的偏斜度现已达到约一个月来的最高水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">截至5月13日的一周，CFTC数据显示，<strong>资产管理公司清算了大量多头头寸，对冲基金则平仓了空头头寸。</strong></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  期权市场对美元的看法，从来没有这么悲观 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">随着特朗普反复无常的关税政策和不断扩大的财政赤字引发市场担忧，期权交易员对美元未来前景的看空达到前所未有的水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月21日根据媒体报道，外汇期权市场的数据显示，交易员对美元未来一年走势的悲观情绪达到有记录以来的最高点。<strong>衡量期权市场买入与卖出某种货币成本差异的1年期风险逆转指标已跌至-27个基点，这意味着看跌期权较看涨期权明显更受青睐。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报道指出，彭博美元即期指数2025年迄今已下跌超过6%，创下该指数二十年来的最差年度开局。<strong>数据显示，市场参与者目前持有约165亿美元押注美元下跌的头寸，几乎创下9月以来的最高水平</strong>。截至周三亚盘时段，美元指数再度跌至100整数关口下方，从年内高点已跌近10%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/16f1c85c-9755-4b85-b6fd-1411b470f824.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="633" data-wscnw="913"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美元信心崩塌的核心导火索在于美国政策的不确定性。特朗普反复无常的关税政策正在严重扰乱市场预期，让投资者质疑美国政策制定的可预测性以及经济增长前景。嘉信理财首席固定收益策略师Kathy Jones直言：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>结构性看跌美元观点仍在，因为关税形势的缓和只是暂时的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>与此同时，<strong>美国财政状况日益恶化也加剧了市场对美元的担忧</strong>。</p>
<p>目前国会正在推进特朗普的大规模减税方案，这将进一步扩大已经高企的联邦赤字。穆迪评级机构上周五晚间更是剥夺了美国的AAA信用评级，理由是过去十年美国政府债务和利息支付大幅增加。</p>
<p>对于投资者而言，这种前所未有的美元悲观情绪意味着美国资产可能面临进一步资金外流压力，同时也提示全球投资组合配置可能需要增加对欧元、日元等替代货币的敞口。</p>
<p>然而，部分分析师也提醒，如此极端的看空情绪有时恰恰可能是美元即将反弹的信号，市场过度悲观可能为逆势交易创造机会。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title: Exclusive: Faith leaders urge religious groups to "recommit to Pride" amid backlash
Description: <p>A coalition of faith leaders is urging religious organizations to openly show their support for LGBTQ+ people ahead of this year's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/pride-month-sponsorship-decline-2025" target="_blank">Pride Month</a>.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The effort comes as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/pride-month-sponsorship-decline-2025" target="_blank">corporations</a> are pulling support for Pride events and as GOP-led states are pushing laws banning <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/utah-bans-lgbtq-pride-flags-on-government-buildings-rcna198716" target="_blank">Pride flags</a> and at least 10 states have introduced bills banning marriage equality.</p><hr><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> This year's Pride Month comes amid uncertainty after President Trump signed an executive order against <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/16/dei-rollback-companies-amazon-meta-mcdonalds" target="_blank">diversity, equity, and inclusion</a>, prompting DEI walk-backs from companies.</p><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>In a <a href="https://www.interfaithalliance.org/recommittopride" target="_blank">letter with a pledge</a> obtained by Axios, the mostly left-leaning faith leaders said "2025 Pride will test the courage of our nation" and "too often religion is used to attack LGBTQ+ people."</p><ul><li>The leaders said millions of dollars are being spent "targeting our Trans siblings" and promoting bills like those banning marriage equality. </li><li>"We, who are from diverse faith traditions and beliefs, are showing up and refusing to back down.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">A short video taken inside an Illinois school captured troubling behavior: A teacher gripping a 6-year-old boy with autism by the ankle and dragging him down the hallway on his back.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">The early-April incident would’ve been upsetting in any school, but it happened at the Garrison School, part of a special education district where at one time students were arrested at the highest rate of any district in the country. The teacher was charged with battery weeks later after pressure from the student’s parents.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">It’s been about eight months since the U.S. Department of Education <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-garrison-school-reform-student-discipline">directed Garrison to change the way it responded to the behavior of students with disabilities</a>. The department said it would monitor the Four Rivers Special Education District, which operates Garrison, following a ProPublica and Chicago Tribune investigation in 2022 that found the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/students-police-arrests-illinois-garrison-school">school frequently involved police and used controversial disciplinary methods</a>. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">But the department’s Office for Civil Rights regional office in Chicago, which was responsible for Illinois and five other states, was one of seven abolished by President Donald Trump’s administration in March; the offices were closed and their entire staff was fired.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.4">The future of oversight at Four Rivers, in west-central Illinois, is now uncertain. There’s no record of any communication from the Education Department to the district since Trump took office, and his administration has terminated an antidiscrimination agreement with at least one school district, in South Dakota.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.5">In the April incident, Xander Reed, who has autism and does not speak, did not stop playing with blocks and go to P.E. when he was told to, according to a police report. Xander then “became agitated and fell to the ground,” the report said. When he refused to get up, a substitute teacher, Rhea Drake, dragged him to the gym.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.6">Another staff member took a photo and alerted school leadership. Principal Amy Haarmann told police that Drake’s actions “were not an acceptable practice at the school,” the police report said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Xander’s family asked to press charges. Drake, who had been working in Xander’s classroom for more than a month, was charged about three weeks later with misdemeanor battery, records show. She has pleaded not guilty. Her attorney told ProPublica that he and Drake did not want to comment for this story. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">Tracey Fair, the district’s director, said school officials made sure students were safe following the incident and that Drake won’t be returning to the district. She declined to comment further about the incident, but said school officials take their “obligation to keep students and staff safe very seriously.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">Doug Thompson, chief of police in Jacksonville, where the school is located, said he could not discuss the case.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Xander’s mother, Amanda, said her son is fearful about going to Garrison, where she said he also has been punished by being put in a school “crisis room,” a small space where students are taken when staff feel they misbehave or need time alone. “He has not wanted to go to school,” she said. “We want him to get an education. We want him to be with other kids.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">Four Rivers serves an eight-county area, and students at Garrison range from kindergartners through high schoolers. About 70 students were enrolled at the start of the school year. Districts who feel they aren’t able to educate a student in neighborhood schools send them to Four Rivers; Xander travels 40 minutes each way to attend Garrison.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">The federal scrutiny of Garrison began after ProPublica and the Tribune revealed that during a five-year period, school employees called police to report student misbehavior every other school day, on average. Police made more than 100 arrests of students as young as 9 during that period. They were handcuffed and taken to the police station for being disruptive or disobedient; if they’d physically lashed out at staff, they often were charged with felony aggravated battery.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">The news organizations also found that Garrison employees frequently removed students from their classrooms and sent them to crisis rooms when the students were upset, disobedient or aggressive.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.1">The Office for Civil Rights’ <a href="https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-agreements/05235001-a.pdf">findings echoed those of the news investigation</a>. It determined that Garrison routinely sent students to police for noncriminal conduct that could have been related to their disabilities — something prohibited by federal law. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.2">The district was to report its progress in making changes to the OCR by last December, which it appears to have done, according to documents ProPublica obtained through a public records request.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.3">But the records show the OCR has not communicated with the district since then and it’s not clear what will come of the work at Four Rivers. The OCR has terminated at least one agreement it entered into last year — a deal with a South Dakota school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. Spokespeople for the Education Department did not respond to questions from ProPublica.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.4">Scott Reed, 6-year-old Xander Reed’s father, said he and Xander’s mother were aware of the frequent use of police as disciplinarians at Four Rivers and of OCR’s involvement. But they reluctantly enrolled him this school year because they were told there were no other options.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.5">“You can say you’ve made all these changes, but you haven’t,” Scott Reed said. For example, he said, even after confirming that Drake had dragged the 50-pound boy down the hall, school leadership sent her home. “They did not call police until I arrived at school and demanded it” hours later, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">New ProPublica reporting has found that since school began in August, police have been called to the school at least 30 times in response to student behavior. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.1">Thompson, the police chief, told ProPublica that, in one instance, officers were summoned because a student was saying “inappropriate things.” They also were called last month after a report that a student punched and bit staff members. The officers “helped to calm the student,” according to the local newspaper’s police blotter. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.2">And police have continued to arrest Garrison students. There have been six arrests of students for property damage or aggravated battery this school year, police data shows. A 15-year-old girl was arrested for spitting in a staff member’s face, and a 10-year-old boy was arrested after being accused of hitting an employee. There were at least nine student arrests last school year, according to police data.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.3">Thompson said four students between the ages of 10 and 16 have been arrested this school year on the more serious aggravated battery charge; one of the students was arrested three times. He said he thinks police calls to Garrison are inevitable, but that school staff are now handling more student behavioral concerns without reaching out to police. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.4">“I feel like now the calls for service are more geared toward they have done what they can and they now need help,” Thompson said. “They have attempted to de-escalate themselves and the student is not cooperating still or it is out of their control and they need more assistance.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.5">Police were called to the school last week to deal with “a disturbance involving a student,” according to the police blotter in Jacksonville’s local newspaper. It didn’t end in an arrest this time; a parent arrived and “made the student obey staff members.”</p>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://modernity.news/2025/05/20/comey-peddles-unbelievable-excuse-for-his-8647-sea-shell-post/"><em>Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey is playing dumb and innocent after essentially calling for President Trump to be assassinated last week, claiming he had no idea his post would be so controversial.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/Comey.jpg?itok=s_WZxdPH" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Comey.jpg?itok=s_WZxdPH"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e390f372-c780-435d-ac3b-cc0fd91dc4db" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Comey.jpg?itok=s_WZxdPH" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>After Comey posted an image of shells on a beach he arranged to read ‘8647’, meaning get rid of Trump, The Secret Service questioned him, but then let him go without any charges.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hZLf6UtIS3" frameborder="0" height="500" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" sandbox="allow-scripts" scrolling="no" security="restricted" src="https://modernity.news/2025/05/17/trump-supporters-rage-at-secret-service-for-not-arresting-comey/embed/#?secret=hZLf6UtIS3" title="“Trump Supporters Rage At Secret Service For Not Arresting Comey” — modernity" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>Now, in an interview with MSNBC he claims he’s just a silly old fella who wears baggy jeans and sweaters and had no idea what he was doing.</p>

<p><em><strong>“I don’t know how we ended up here. Never occurred to me that it was any kind of controversial thing, but that’s the time we live in,” </strong></em>Comey told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace.</p>

<p>It’s got nothing to do with the time we live in, shit posting an image threatening to kill the President when you’re a deep state lackey is always going to cause outrage.</p>

<p>Comey then claimed that he wasn’t the one who arranged the shells, and they were put there by some other TDS addled leftist.</p>

<p><em><strong>“We were walking on the beach, we went to the beach to prepare for this week… and we were walking back towards the road and we saw in the sand someone had arranged shells with numbers. And Patrice, my wife, said, ‘why would someone put an address in the sand?’ and I said, ‘I don’t know’ and we stood over and I said, ‘I think it’s some kind of political message.'”</strong></em></p>

<p>Hurling his own wife under a bus, Comey then added, “She said you know, when I was a server – she did a lot of work in restaurants – 86 meant to remove an item from the menu when you ran out of ingredients. And I said, ‘well to me, as a kid it always meant to leave a place, to ditch a place.’ And she said well that’s very clever you should take a picture of that and I did and posted it on my Instagram and thought nothing more of it until I heard through her that people were saying that it was a call for some sort of assassination which is crazy!”</p>

<p>Pfffffft, SURE.</p>

<p><em>“<strong>The shells were the same color for each of the letters, the different colors for the letters. It took a lot of work.

Title: Schiff On Gold In A Multipolar Currency Regime
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Schiff On Gold In A Multipolar Currency Regime</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/gold-in-a-multipolar-currency-regime"><em>Via SchiffGold.com,</em></a></p>

<p>For now, the U.S. dollar still reigns supreme as the world’s reserve currency. <strong>But cracks in this hegemony are widening,</strong> and in the wake of de-dollarization, there’s <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/2025-etf-inflows-are-recognition-of-the-golden-bull">a golden opportunity</a> for the yellow metal to re-emerge as a neutral global reserve asset in a multipolar currency regime. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/gold-bars-stacked.jpg?itok=OoIYJdtl" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold-bars-stacked.jpg?itok=OoIYJdtl"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ca0dc10a-a02a-4b05-86aa-90fbff589fa8" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold-bars-stacked.jpg?itok=OoIYJdtl" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>As nations like China, India, and Russia challenge the dollar’s monopoly, the rise of a multi-currency world underscores why physical gold is not just a hedge, but a strategic necessity.</strong></p>

<p>The dollar’s dominance, cemented by the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, has rested on its role as the primary medium for international trade, oil pricing, and reserve holdings. Yet, its foundation is eroding. The U.S. national debt exceeds $33 trillion, with <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/interest-debt-grow-past-1-trillion-next-year">interest payments projected to hit $1 trillion</a> annually next year. </p>

<p><strong>Decades of quantitative easing have bloated the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, diluting the dollar’s purchasing power. </strong>Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions—sanctions on Russia, trade disputes with China—have further fed global de-dollarization. Now we have high inflation, interest rates that are still way too low, and a ballooning debt. In fact, <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/treasury-has-paid-out-941b-in-interest-over-the-last-12-months">almost half of new debt in 2024 came from interest payments</a> on the debt itself. In that scenario, it would be impossible for other countries not to start considering de-dollarization more seriously.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening. <strong>Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/percent-global-fx-reserves-dollars-ticks-up-amounts-fall-imf-data-shows-2025-03-31/">a steady decline in the dollar’s share of global foreign exchange reserves</a>.</strong> Central banks keep stockpiling gold at a historic pace, especially in Poland and BRICS-aligned countries. As the rest of the world continues to lose trust in the dollar, they’ll bet on gold as a neutral, non-politicized asset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/uncategorized/treasury-yields-running-amok-amidst-tariff-madness">Look at Treasurys: they’ve been swinging wildly</a> since Trump’s trade wars began and are now sitting over 4.5%.  The dollar’s exorbitant privilege has always been unsustainable, and with the world increasingly realizing that we can’t fix our fiscal mess, a multipolar currency regime is an unfolding reality. </p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1922327956925366308">As Peter Schiff recently said</a> on X:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en" xml:lang="en">The yield on 10-year Treasuries is back up to 4.5% as the U.S. dollar resumes its broad-based decline. Despite the trade truce, the world is losing confidence in the dollar and our ability to get our fiscal house in order. The consequences of de-dollarization will be profound.</p>
— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1922327956925366308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>A multipolar currency regime envisions a world where no single national currency dominates.</strong> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative">China is increasingly pushing for different ways to exchange yuan</a> instead of dollars. Russia’s push for gold-backed trade with other BRICS nations is also accelerating the shift. The <a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/business/brics-summit-currency-talks-gold-silver-soar/">2024 BRICS summit floated proposals for a gold-linked trade unit</a>, a direct challenge to the petrodollar.</p>

<p>After years of exporting our inflation, taking advantage of cheap manufacturing elsewhere, and using the threat of war to enforce petrodollar supremacy, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/theyre-ripping-us-off-trumps-long-standing-grievance/story?id=120447216">Trump claims we’re being “ripped off.”</a> In reality, his policies are smashing through everything that has allowed America to enjoy our standard of living to begin with. Those are the same factors that have allowed the dollar to survive for so long.</p>

<p><strong>As nations diversify away from dollar-denominated assets, gold’s share in global reserves is climbing. </strong></p>

<p>With the government’s culture of blatantly unsustainable borrowing trickling down to consumers, America’s unpayable debt cannot simply go on forever. Now other countries are not only realizing it, but acting on it. Though the story of unipolar <a href="https://www.schiffsovereign.com/video/golds-rise-warns-of-dollars-demise-ep-1022/">dollar dominance was always bound to come to an end</a>, in this case, the finale will be a spectacular collapse that upends the way of life Americans have become so accustomed to. </p>

<p>2008 was nothing, and neither was the Great Depression, compared to the end of the dollar’s reign. The longer it gets put off, the worse it will be in the end. However, for better or worse, it may be coming soon. As <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/interviews/schiff-on-metals-and-miners-dollar-bubble-will-humble-the-economy">Peter recently said on Metals and Miners</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“…stagflation, a combination of a weak economy and rising interest rates, is the one scenario that the Fed never stress tested any of the banks for…They did not run a stress test where you have a recession with high unemployment, but inflation and interest rates go up, not down.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The IMF reports that gold now accounts for significantly more of total reserves than it did a decade ago. Other countries know that gold is the ultimate safe haven, not US Treasurys. As the multipolar world takes shape, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bond-market-weakness-could-drive-gold-prices-higher-despite-tariff-pause-peter-schiff/ar-AA1EFQkU">the dollar’s decline could trigger volatility in equities, bonds, and real estate</a>—assets that are tethered to the stability of the dollar.</p>

<p><strong>Gold thrives in uncertainty.</strong> Its price has skyrocketed this year, outpacing inflation and most asset classes. However, its true value lies not in short-term gains, but in its role as a wealth preserver when currencies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iBsgcKcyM">the US dollar collapse</a> under the weight of inflationary mismanagement and central planning hubris. </p>

<p><strong>As demand for dollars goes down it will devalue U.S. assets, particularly Treasuries, which foreign entities hold to the tune of trillions. <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/the-dollar-falters-as-gold-remains-stable">As the dollar’s shadow fades</a>, gold reclaims its role as the world’s ultimate store of value—unchained, enduring, and essential.</strong></p>

Title: Orchestrating Microservices with Dapr: A Unified Approach
Description: <h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Modern software architectures are increasingly embracing microservices to improve scalability, flexibility, and resilience. However, as the number of systems expands, managing inter-service communication, data persistence, event-driven messaging, and security becomes more complex. Additionally, as a product scales, organizations often inadvertently develop strong dependencies on specific database providers, messaging middleware, or cloud vendors. This tight coupling makes future changes challenging, often requiring extensive refactoring.</p>
<p data-end="1050" data-start="791"><a href="https://dapr.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong data-end="833" data-start="791">Dapr</strong></a><strong data-end="833" data-start="791">&nbsp;(Distributed Application Runtime)</strong> offers a unified abstraction for handling these concerns, allowing microservices to interact with databases, message queues, APIs, and secrets stores in a cloud-agnostic and infrastructure-independent manner.</p>

Title: Next-Gen IoT Performance Depends on Advanced Power Management ICs
Description: <p dir="ltr">The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a key integrated circuit (IC) market driver. As these internet-connected technologies become increasingly smaller, complex, and energy-intensive, advanced power management ICs are exponentially important. Factoring in potential energy reliability issues due to heightened demand emphasizes this situation’s urgency.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks to its convenience and affordability, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/the-internet-of-things-development-and-examples">the IoT</a> is quickly becoming a staple in industrial, medical, and technology spaces. Since demand is so high, research and development are flourishing. However, progress may soon stall unless professionals leverage advanced power management integrated circuit (PMIC) design to handle variable input and regulate voltage.</p>

Title: Next Evolution in Integration: Architecting With Intent Using Model Context Protocol
Description: <p style="text-align: left;">Integration has moved beyond system connectivity. In todays distributed digital first environments the focus has shifted from building statics connections to intelligent context aware interactions. The next phase of integration is to build the integration with intent using <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/building-custom-tools-model-context-protocol">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> design pattern. In this article, I will explain how integration evolved over the period from traditional middleware to cloud native approach to a design centric approach that aligns integration with meaning and intent. We will examine the architecture of MCP and how it's going to play a pivotal role in driving next-generation integration strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Integration in Middleware Era: Reliable, but Rigid</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Early integration strategies relied on centralized middleware and formal contracts like SOAP and XML. Systems were prioritized for consistency and reliability. The rigid contract definition and static service definition made them slow to adapt and very expensive to evolve. Development were often done in tools which required deep expertise and managing this has become huge overhead for organizations.&nbsp;</p>

Title: Building Reliable LLM-Powered Microservices With Kubernetes on AWS

To improve user experiences through conversational interfaces, content creation, data analysis, and other features, organizations are progressively integrating these models into their systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, implementing LLMs in production settings, especially as microservices, presents special difficulties that conventional application deployment techniques are not designed to handle.</p>

Title: Building an AI/ML Data Lake With Apache Iceberg
Description: <p>As companies collect massive amounts of data to fuel their artificial intelligence and machine learning initiatives, finding the right data architecture for storing, managing, and accessing such data is crucial.

Title: Parameters to Measure in Chaos Engineering Experiments
Description: <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Chaos Engineering, System Resilience, Failure Injection, Performance Metrics, Fault Tolerance</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/chaos-engineering-for-microservices">Chaos Engineering</a> is an essential practice for testing system resilience by intentionally injecting failures and analyzing the system’s response. This journal explores key parameters to measure in Chaos Engineering experiments, including system performance, availability, fault tolerance, and user experience metrics. By systematically monitoring these parameters, organizations can proactively identify weaknesses, enhance failover mechanisms, and optimize recovery strategies. The study also provides a structured experiment template to help teams document and analyze chaos experiments effectively. The ultimate goal is to build confidence in a system’s ability to withstand turbulent operational conditions and ensure reliable service delivery.</p>

Title: Secrets Sprawl and AI: Why Your Non-Human Identities Need Attention Before You Deploy That LLM
Description: <p>It seems every company today is excited about AI. Whether they are rolling out GitHub Copilot to help teams write boilerplate code in seconds or creating internal chatbots to answer support tickets faster than ever, large language models (LLMs) have driven us into a new frontier of productivity very rapidly. Advancements like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have let teams plug LLMs into internal knowledge bases, making them context-aware and therefore much more helpful to the end user.</p>
<p>However, if you haven’t gotten your secrets under control, especially those tied to your growing fleet of <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-non-human-identities-governance">non-human identities</a> (NHIs), <strong>AI might speed up your security incident rate, not just your team's output</strong>. Before you deploy a new LLM or connect Jira, Confluence, or your internal API docs to your internal chat-based agent, let’s talk about the real risk hiding in plain sight: secrets sprawl and the world of ungoverned non-human identities.</p>

Title: How to Build Real-Time BI Systems: Architecture, Code, and Best Practices
Description: <p data-end="816" data-start="440">In today’s fast-paced digital economy, <strong data-end="536" data-start="479">real-time data is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity</strong>. Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) systems, which rely on batch processing, introduce significant latency that can hinder timely decisions. Whether it's detecting fraud in banking or optimizing ICU bed allocation in hospitals, <strong data-end="815" data-start="769">delay equals lost opportunity or even risk</strong>.</p>
<p data-end="1167" data-start="818">Real-time BI turns this around by enabling systems to ingest, process, and visualize data within seconds or even milliseconds of generation. In this article, we’ll walk through the <strong data-end="1058" data-start="999">architecture, tools, and practical implementation steps</strong> required to build a real-time BI system, from ingestion and processing to analytics storage and dashboarding.&nbsp;</p>

Title: How Kubernetes Cluster Sizing Affects Performance and Cost Efficiency in Cloud Deployments
Description: <p dir="ltr">Kubernetes has become the de facto solution for container orchestration when deploying applications in the cloud. It enables developers to scale applications easily and provides reliable management.&nbsp;</p>

Title: Cloud Security and Privacy: Best Practices to Mitigate the Risks
Description: <p>Cloud security refers to technologies, best practices, and safety guidelines that help to protect your data from human errors, insider and security threats. Therefore, it naturally covers a wide range of procedures, which are aimed at securing systems from data breaches, data loss, unauthorized access, and other cybersecurity-related risks that are growing from year to year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to GitProtect's State of DevOps Threats report, the number of incidents in GitHub grew by over 20%, and around 32% of events in GitLab had an impact on service performance and customers. Moreover, it’s worth mentioning that the cost of failures is growing as well. Thus, the average cost of recovering from a ransomware attack is around $2.73 million, the average cost of a data breach is $4.88 million, and every minute of downtime can cost up to $ 9 K.&nbsp;</p>

Title: Trump can complain all he wants – but he can’t stop his own economic mess | Sidney Blumenthal
Description: <p>Between his tariffs and his regressive ‘big, beautiful bill’, the president is wreaking havoc – and he never learns</p><p>With his usual threats, Donald Trump is trying to ward off the dire reality that he has created and is bearing down on him. He can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/16/venezuelans-deported-trump-lawyers-torture">clamp migrants in foreign gulags</a>, coerce white-shoe law firms into becoming his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/12/big-law-pro-bono-legal-work-trump">pro bono serfs</a> and try to simply <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/">erase the National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, but he can’t rescind his harm to the economy. Trump can <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/noaa-scrambling-fill-forecasting-jobs-cuts-national-weather-service-rcna207050">slash the National Weather Service</a>, but he can’t stop the storm he’s whipped up. He’s shouting into the wind at his twister.</p><p>No matter how much he might lower his draconian tariffs after his 90-day breathing spell, the velocity of damage is just building. It’s not a mistake that can be rectified. There’s no do-over. It’s not a golf game at one of his clubs where he gets endless mulligans and is declared the champion.

Title: Don’t be fooled. Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is typically ugly and typically misnamed | Arwa Mahdawi
Description: <p>Republicans love to make the most harmful laws sound sensible or even noble. This pretty-sounding package of tax breaks and spending cuts is just the latest example</p><p>What’s big, beautiful and kept a lot of Republicans up late on Sunday night? There might be various responses to that question, but the answer I’m looking for is <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25944505-one-big-beautiful-bill/">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>. Coming in at 1,116 pages, the bill isn’t quite War and Peace but it’s definitely big. Whether the mega-package of tax breaks and spending cuts is beautiful, however, is up for debate.</p><p>And there has certainly been a lot of debate. The bill has been in limbo for a while because a few Republicans who consider themselves “fiscally conservative” are happy with the package’s extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increased spending for the military and immigration enforcement, but don’t think enough social and climate-related programmes have been slashed to pay for it all. In particular, they want deeper cuts to food stamps and <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-medicaid/">Medicaid</a>, which is a government programme providing health care to low-income people. Late on Sunday, however, in an unusual weekend vote, the hardliners relented a little and the House Budget Committee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/19/trump-tax-cuts-bill-house-republicans">revived the bill</a>. It still faces some challenges, but it is now closer to becoming law.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Title: The trouble with AI art isn’t just lack of originality. It’s something far bigger | Eric Reinhart
Description: <p>When artwork is invented by a machine, it loses its most important power: to help people connect. In an already lonely era, that is particularly dangerous</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) giant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai">OpenAI</a> recently announced that its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> platform now provides free image generation, prompting an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/style/ai-chatgpt-studio-ghibli.html">online flood</a> of images imitating the styles of the animator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and other well-known artists. This has been heralded as the next step in the death of art and artists, joining the impending death – or <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/18/2024/ai-assisted-novels-are-winning-more-awards">zombification</a> – of the writer, as AI-generated novels are slated to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/26/writers-condemn-startups-plans-to-publish-8000-books-next-year-using-ai-spines-artificial-intelligence">flood the market</a>. But a peculiar feeling, or rather lack thereof, arises when trying to engage with AI art objects.</p><p>It is not simply that AI lacks originality; after all, so too does most human art. The problem runs far deeper: the essence of art is lost in the process of its machinic invention and, with it, the very possibility of a democratic society is put under threat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/20/ai-art-concerns-originality-connection">Continue reading...</a>

Title:  G7会后，贝森特施压日本，美元开启新跌势？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">在G7财长会议前夕，花旗银行警告称<strong>美国政府不太可能&#34;积极追求&#34;弱势美元政策，但随着美国与其贸易伙伴达成降低关税的协议，美元仍存贬值风险</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，花旗在5月20日的报告中指出，<strong>随着高关税推动美国通胀上升，美国不会寻求类似1985年广场协议那样的广泛协议来削弱美元，而是将强调央行在货币政策上的作用，在贸易谈判中可能会要求包括日本在内的亚洲经济体货币升值</strong>。</p>
<p>根据<a href="https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4MjflZqWqK4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">环球时报</a>，日美两国政府计划在本周于加拿大举行的七国集团（G7）财长与央行行长会议后，举行第三轮日美关税谈判。而在周二开始的G7会议之前，货币政策早已成为焦点。<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2912927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">日本财政大臣周二早些时候表示</a>，他正在安排在<strong>G7会议期间与美国财政部长贝森特举行双边会议，讨论包括外汇在内的议题</strong>。花旗策略师写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>随着高关税被逆转，美国维持强势美元政策的动机将减弱，我们认为美元将偏向贬值。</p>

<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="1b435584">贝森特或将施压日本，日元面临升值压力？</h2>
</div>
<p>花旗表示在当前环境下，日本和韩国在经济和国家安全方面都高度依赖美国。</p>
<p>花旗指出，日本货币基于实际有效汇率明显偏弱，且其外汇储备规模位居世界第二。日本的经常账户盈余也很大，反映了国内需求不足的问题。在美国将进行贸易谈判的一系列国家中，日本既是最重要的贸易伙伴，也是最容易接近的对象。</p>
<p>美国财政部长贝森特曾在2022年发表的《安倍的复杂遗产》一文中表明了他对央行货币政策影响金融经济的重视，并关注外汇储备投资政策对美国利率的影响。在该文章末尾，贝森特指出安倍经济学&#34;三支箭&#34;中的&#34;第一支箭&#34;——<strong>日本央行的超宽松货币政策可能鼓励了全球金融机构和投资者的风险承担行为</strong>。他同时表达了对日本央行货币政策正常化过程可能触发全球金融危机的担忧。</p>
<p>花旗指出从贝森特2022年的报告可以看出，他对日本非常了解<strong>。在未来美日贸易谈判中，贝森特可能将就日本央行货币政策问题进行讨论</strong>。花旗分析师指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们怀疑，<strong>货币（兑美元）升值可能被要求作为降低关税谈判的一部分。</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>分析师认为在整个东亚（包括韩国、日本和中国台湾）的背景下，<strong>贝森特领导的贸易谈判可能会选择更为温和的解决方案，而不是单方面寻求高关税并要求日本推动日元大幅升值</strong>。</p>
<p>本次G7会议可能不会带来剧烈的汇率协议，但投资者应密切关注会后美元走势。随着美国推进贸易谈判，东亚货币，尤其是日元可能面临升值压力。日本央行货币政策可能成为美日经贸谈判的重要议题，日元汇率调整可能呈现渐进而非剧烈变化的特点。</p>

Title:  山姆扩张、卖场调改——沃尔玛“变革”进行时 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛正试图讲述山姆之外的新故事。</p><p style="text-align: left">截至4月30日的最新财季，沃尔玛全球净销售额1656亿美元，同比增长2.5%；营业利润71.4亿美元，同比增长4.3%。</p><p style="text-align: left">作为沃尔玛在本土市场外最受关注的高增长区域之一，中国市场一季度实现净销售额67亿美元，同比增长22.5%。</p><p style="text-align: left">线下门店可比销售可比销售增长率为16.8%，比去年同期高4.3个百分点。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>近年来，沃尔玛在中国的大卖场业务持续收缩，以山姆为核心的会员店和电商业务蒸蒸日上。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">一季度末，沃尔玛中国卖场仅余280家，较比五年前萎缩近三成。</p><p style="text-align: left">不过随着新一代大卖场、社区小店的相继亮相，沃尔玛的新面貌正越来越多出现在人们面前。</p><p style="text-align: left">在零售变革加速的当下，传统龙头的动作加速正带来更多期待。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">山姆向上</h2><p style="text-align: left"><strong>山姆会员店支撑着沃尔玛中国的业绩表现。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">山姆会员店在华保持着每年5-6家的高速扩张速度，逐步由一线核心城市向张家港、晋江、昆山等经济发达的“百强县”下沉。</p><p style="text-align: left">行业推算，山姆中国2024年销售额可能突破1000亿元，达到沃尔玛中国业绩的七成。</p><p style="text-align: left">即便如此，仍未满足蓬勃的需求，甚至催生出山姆代购这门“月入过万”的好生意。</p><p style="text-align: left">受益于会员规模逐步扩大，中国山姆会员店一季度会员收入增幅超过40%。</p><p style="text-align: left">零售竞争白热化的当下，山姆的扩张速度再创新高，2025年全年开店数或有望超过7家。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>比门店跑的更快的，是围绕母店布局的前置仓。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">山姆在线下门店约4000个SKU中，精选出1000个高复购、适宜配送的SKU。以前置仓的形式在城市中进行灵活加密，对现有门店覆盖范围形成补充。</p><p style="text-align: left">前置仓作为高效的小型履约中心，选址在会员和潜在会员集中度较高的区域，由母店作为中心枢纽，负责管理和补给。</p><p style="text-align: left">每个山姆会员店管理约8到15个前置仓，每个前置仓覆盖2-3公里半径的商圈，超过八成订单可在一小时内送达。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>前置仓玩家普遍面临的成本挑战，并没有给山姆带来太多困扰。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">山姆前置仓承袭会员店的强大商品力，以及消费、忠诚度高的会员群体，平均客单价超过200元，较易覆盖高昂的履约成本。</p><p style="text-align: left">至今山姆全国前置仓数量已超500个，日均订单超千单，成为赛道无可争议头部玩家。</p><p style="text-align: left">作为山姆的“第二增长曲线”，云仓为代表的电商业务提升了存量门店的店效、复购率等指标。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>当前，山姆中国线上销售占比已超过50%，被沃尔玛中国总裁兼CEO朱晓静评价为“门店资产价值倍增”。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">她表示，到2025年底，山姆中国年销能超过5亿美元的门店数，将会从2023年的2家店，增长到8家。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">大卖场变革</h2><p style="text-align: left"><strong>山姆高歌猛进的同时，沃尔玛没有放弃对大卖场业态的转型与创新探索。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">打造线下零售的差异化、体验感的同时，强化商品竞争力。</p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛将高品质、便捷的一日三餐解决方案、大牌低价的专享商品、独特有惊喜感的宝藏商品，视作商品转型的三大方向。</p><p style="text-align: left">2024年底在云南亮相的新一代门店，在选品规划、陈列布局上已与传统大卖场显著不同。</p><p style="text-align: left">取消了主通道陈列，采用了更低的开放式货架；商品并非按照类别严格划分，而是使用场景的关联性进行交叉陈列，去渍滚珠也可能出现在火锅食材区。</p><p style="text-align: left">“自有商品”+“大牌精选特供”的选品逻辑类似山姆，但提供更多小包装选项，明确聚焦注重性价比的“大众中产小家庭”。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>对于更小型的社区零售业态的试验也在进行中。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">近期沃尔玛重启小店模型，在深圳开出500平的社区小店。以烘焙、预包装生鲜、即食加工品为核心品类，与盒马NB和奥乐齐颇为接近。</p><p style="text-align: left">此前有消息称，新的小店模型可能会借鉴和模仿山姆云仓的形式，以沃尔玛大店为依托，优选品项，以前置仓的模式拓展线上业务。</p><p style="text-align: left">有用户发现，在社区店“南山新德家园店”下单的商品，是由“蛇口沃尔玛店”配送的。双方大概率共享商品线，并在库存及供应链上有所协同。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>因此有猜测认为，云店仓一体化或将在沃尔玛KA卖场、山姆会员商店、沃尔玛社区小店得到复制和协同。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>以仓店模式为抓手抢占即时零售风口，已经成为实体商超全渠道转型的主流选项。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛在相关领域已有不小投入。</p><p style="text-align: left">去年12月，沃尔玛中国与美团达成战略合作，全国门店将全面上线美团，并接入美团配送。双方的合作还包含仓店模式、履约配送服务升级等。</p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛同时降低配送门槛，鲜食29元免运费，并再次升级履约效能和范围。</p><p style="text-align: left">例如“极速达”业务由原来的一小时达提升至“最快30分钟达”，加密“准时达”站点布局，将顾客服务范围扩大至门店5-15公里，配送时效为2-3小时。</p><h2 style="text-align: left">贸易逆风</h2><p style="text-align: left"><strong>全渠道探索在沃尔玛的北美大本营也在同步进行。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">通过无人机配送、GoLocal本地物流网络，外加自动化物流中心建设，美国市场正在努力复制中国的“1小时达”场景。</p><p style="text-align: left">一季度，沃尔玛美国电商销售额增长21%，连续第12个季度实现两位数增长。山姆会员店电商销售同比增长27%，占比提升至17%。</p><p style="text-align: left">在美国，9成以上家庭能享受3小时内极速送达服务，电商对可比销售额的贡献达到3.5个百分点，创一年多以来的新高。</p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛美国的电商业务不仅限于到店提货、门店配送等与实体门店直接相关的销售收入，还包含在线广告（Walmart Connect）等创新业务。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>在全球市场，沃尔玛电商不断强化平台属性，电商及广告正共同成为这家传统零售企业的增长极。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">参照亚马逊Prime会员计划，沃尔玛推出了Walmart+。通过为会员提供更快的配送服务和更丰富的市场选择，沃尔玛不断吸引更多活跃用户在线订购。</p><p style="text-align: left">一季度，Walmart+会员收入实现了两位数增长。活跃用户数量的提升，推动Walmart Connect广告业务实现了31%的增长。</p><p style="text-align: left">市场期待电商、广告等多元化业务发展，将赋予这家传统零售商更强的盈利能力。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>只是这份期待正被关税政策吹来的“强逆风”影响。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">不同于山姆在中国的消费升级路线，沃尔玛近年在北美执行低价必须品策略，吸纳因通胀而消费降级的中产。</p><p style="text-align: left">由于在美所售产品中约三分之一为进口商品，沃尔玛的低价政策正随着关税政策的不稳定性而动摇。</p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛在业绩会上表示，将尽最大努力保持低价，但“考虑到零售业利润微薄的现实，我们也无法吸收所有压力。&#34;</p><p style="text-align: left">“如果某物有30%的关税，你很可能会看到两位数的价格上涨。”沃尔玛CFO表示，价格调整很可能会在5月底生效，6月份价格将“大幅上涨”。</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>不确定性仍笼罩在这家零售巨头上方。</strong></p><p style="text-align: left">沃尔玛预计第二财季净销售额将增长3.5%至4.5%，但并未提供每股收益或营业收入增长预期。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  减税法案国会遇阻，特朗普不耐烦了，威胁共和党“不支持就被淘汰” 
Description:  <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>特朗普正努力推动减税计划通过，但面临两大障碍——医保削减规模和州地方税减免上限(SALT)问题。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>据媒体报道，</strong>特朗普周二出人意料地访问国会山，试图压制共和党内部分歧，推动其税收和支出议程迅速通过分裂的众议院。在闭门会议中，特朗普毫不客气地警告反对者：&#34;不要在医保上胡搞&#34;，并对持不同意见的议员发出政治威胁。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">特朗普还对提高州和地方税减免上限的要求日益不耐烦。在周二的会议上，他坚持SALT减免上限应保持在法案草案中的30000美元水平，是目前10000美元上限的三倍。但对一些共和党议员来说仍然不够。媒体称这些来自纽约、新泽西和加州等高税收州的议员坚持认为，目前法案中提出的州和地方税(SALT)扣除上限不足以满足其选民需求。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="salt">特朗普失去耐心，对SALT要求表示不满</h2>
<p>5月20日据媒体报道，特朗普周二前往国会山与共和党众议院党团会面，试图说服关键的蓝州共和党议员放弃对税改法案的反对，但未能成功。<strong>众议院议长迈克·约翰逊（Mike Johnson）和特朗普希望在阵亡将士纪念日周末前通过这项法案，但&#34;SALT核心小组&#34;的五名成员的坚决反对可能使这一时间表无法实现</strong>。</p>
<p>据媒体，在周二的会议上，特朗普直接对&#34;SALT核心小组&#34;说：&#34;放手吧&#34;。</p>
<p>对纽约共和党代表迈克·劳勒（Mike Lawler）——该法案的反对者之一，特朗普更加直白：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我比你更了解你的选区。如果你因为SALT而输掉选举，那你注定会输。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>共和党领导层曾提议将上限提高到4万美元，但该提议仅适用于年收入75.16万美元或以下的人群，且这一上限将持续四年，之后对收入3万美元或以下的人群降至3万美元</strong>。然而，&#34;SALT核心小组&#34;的五名成员仍然表示将对目前的法案投反对票。</p>
<p>&#34;我的中产阶级选民不应被排除在这个过程之外，&#34;纽约共和党议员Nick LaLota在会后表示。来自亚利桑那州的共和党强硬派众议员安迪·比格斯表示，他对迅速推进该法案的呼吁无动于衷，并表示他更关注最终成果而不是时间表。</p>
<p>特朗普建议来自纽约和其他高税收州的共和党人再等等，<strong>在国会完成税收立法后再尝试进一步提高SALT限制</strong>。然而，这一提议可能会引起SALT议员的强烈反对，因为他们认为总统的&#34;美丽大法案&#34;是解决这一自2017年以来政治优先事项的唯一机会。</p>
<p>尽管面临重重困难，众议院议长约翰逊仍保持乐观：&#34;我们将就推动这项立法所需的一切达成协议，&#34;他在周二表示，并仍计划在本周结束前在众议院进行投票。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="d8cbf9e1">保守派坚持更深层次的医疗补助削减</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>税改法案面临的另一大障碍来自保守派共和党人，他们要求在医疗补助和营养计划等项目上进行更大规模的削减</strong>。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">特朗普警告保守派不要在医保问题上纠缠，但马里兰众议员、众议院自由核心小组主席安迪·哈里斯（Andy Harris）在会议后表示仍将反对目前的税收法案：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们在医疗补助方面做得不够。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>尽管<strong>当前版本的立法已包含对有劳动能力的成年人设置工作要求，并对更多医疗补助受益者收取医疗服务费用的内容，但这些措施对保守派议员而言仍显不足</strong>。</p>

Title:  散户汹涌逢低买入美股之际，对冲基金大举做空 
Description:  <p>在散户汹涌逢低买入美股、无视负面消息和不确定性之际，对冲基金大举做空。高盛交易员Robert Quinn指出，尽管纳指近几周表现优异，但在同一时期，新增空头头寸竟远超多头开仓，令人意外。</p>
<p><strong>根据5月6日至13日的COT（交易者持仓报告）数据，市场出现大规模的做空行为，达到111亿美元，虽然也有42亿美元的买入开仓，但整体净多头头寸仍减少69亿美元。</strong></p>
<p><strong>做空主力是对冲基金。Quinn指出，对冲基金净卖出额为73亿美元，其中做空激增，达到94亿美元。</strong>其他类型投资者的净多仓也减少了8.3亿美元。资产管理机构和非报告投资者则分别买入9.4亿美元和3亿美元。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ee5b7639-d781-49df-ad53-211843967f7e.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="393" data-wscnw="500" data-wscnsize="30161"/></p>
<p>不过需要说明的是，对冲基金的“空头仓位激增”并不完全是市场方向判断，也有可能是为了对冲其他多头建仓行为的套利操作。</p>
<p>尽管如此，对冲基金的做空规模仍然是相当空前的，凸显他们对美股市场上涨的怀疑。<strong>最近三期COT报告显示，对冲基金累计做空金额高达250亿美元，为过去至少十年来的最大规模。</strong></p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/58aa0beb-09e3-48e8-bc79-5bc7cb141577.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="393" data-wscnw="500" data-wscnsize="33426"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>对冲基金空仓占总未平仓合约的比例达到了41%，是自2021年2月以来的最高水平。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a06739de-89ed-479a-828f-01b118e5b39a.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="393" data-wscnw="500" data-wscnsize="30263"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>此外，一些CEO的言论看起来也与对冲基金保持一致，似乎站在了“聪明钱”那一边。通常，CEO的信心与美股走势成正相关，但是当前出现了极大的偏离。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/dcb0fbf9-3b58-4d9e-a514-adc13151fa0b.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="255" data-wscnw="500" data-wscnsize="23965"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>美国总统特朗普宣布关税90天暂停以来，在散户投资者积极买入的背景下，美股经历了大幅反弹。本周一，就连穆迪下调美国评级也不畏惧，散户投资者创纪录的抄底买入、净买入额达到了惊人的54亿美元，令美股当日V型反转。</p>
<p>与此同时，市场对美联储的降息预期大幅回落。</p>
<p>此外，近几个月的“硬数据”保持韧性，支持了增长预期与股市，而“软数据”则剧烈波动，密歇根大学消费者信心指数凸显这一点，该调查显示出消费者信心崩塌、通胀预期飙升。</p>
<p>财经金融博客Zerohedge点评称，高盛的交易部门认为，只有三件事很重要：CTA、回购和散户买入。当前，CTA在任何情况下都是买家，散户在每次下跌时都会继续买入，年初至今的回购授权刚刚创下历史新高。祝做空者好运。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  达利欧：美联储处境艰难，不应当降息，警告“不合适的降息”后果 
Description:  <p>周二，对冲基金桥水的创始人达利欧在出席活动时，被问及鉴于目前美国的经济状况，美联储是否有降息的空间。对此，达利欧表示，美联储处境艰难，不应当降息。</p>
<p data-start="158" data-end="246">达利欧认为，美联储当前不应降息，降息并不是合适的货币政策选择。他指出，美联储处在一个非常困难的境地，需要在多种因素间进行权衡。当前存在巨大的不确定性，市场情绪也在恶化，但实际上，实体经济本身还没有出现显著的问题。所以，美联储的处境非常棘手。</p>
<p data-start="250" data-end="357">达利欧提到，从更长远的角度看，政治因素将对未来的货币政策有影响。若有新一任美联储主席上台，更可能推动降息，因为当权者通常偏好经济刺激。此外，由于利率对偿债成本有巨大影响，而现在债务水平如此之高，降息的压力也会随之增加，降息可以减轻偿债负担。</p>
<p>达利欧指出，一个人的债务是另一个人的资产。所以问题就在于，如果把利率压低，那么资产的回报率就会降低。那么，利率是如何被压低的呢？可能会出现利率下调的情况，但最终还是要通过某种形式的干预来实现，而这些干预措施会削弱货币的价值，所以这就带来了“货币价值的矛盾”。</p>
<p>达利欧认为，如果设想不久的将来，货币政策发生变化，同时也考虑到中期选举的影响，那将是一个令人非常担忧的时期：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>如果市场看到一个，比如说，一个过于激进或不合适的降息举措，那么这实际上可能会对债券市场产生非常负面的影响。因为这样做会推动长期利率上升，也就是收益率曲线陡峭化，同时也可能导致美元贬值、黄金价格上涨，这种动态反映出市场正在逃离债券市场，因为货币的价值变得重要了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>本周，美联储二、三号人物等重量级高官发声，暗示利率可能维持到至少9月，亚特兰大联储主席博斯蒂克预计年内可能只有一次降息。投资者目前认为6月的下次FOMC会议上降息的可能性不足10%，并预计年内仅降息两次，每次25个基点，低于4月底时市场预期的四次降息。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  马斯克表决心：至少再干五年特斯拉CEO除非“去世”，不会再大把砸钱掺和选举 
Description:  <p>马斯克一边坚持要继续抓好特斯拉，表决心未来一些年都要继续领导公司，一边又表态要“放手”，不会像过去参与美国大选那样在政治上大举投入。</p>
<p>特斯拉的投资者可以松口气了，不过，美国总统特朗普和共和党就要失去一位大“金主”了。</p>
<p>马斯克同时表示，下月Robotaxi车就将在特斯拉总部得州奥斯汀市上路，xAI还将兴建AI工厂、采购AI芯片。</p>
<h2>继续掌舵特斯拉至少五年</h2>
<p>美东时间5月20日周二，在远程参与卡塔尔经济论坛期间，马斯克表示，他计划至少未来五年继续担任特斯拉CEO，除非“我去世”，否则不会放弃领导特斯拉。“是的，对此毫无疑问。”</p>
<p>马斯克强调，他希望保持对特斯拉的控制权并不是出于金钱考虑：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“这不是钱的问题，而是对公司未来的合理控制问题。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>马斯克批评了两次否决他2018年巨额薪酬方案的特拉华州法官，并重申，希望拥有更多特斯拉股份是为了保持足够的投票控制权，防止被激进投资者赶出公司。</p>
<p>评论认为，马斯克的以上声明来得正是时候，因为投资者越来越担忧他对特斯拉的投入不足，特别是今年他领导特朗普的政府效率部（DOGE）之后。</p>
<p>马斯克讲话后，周二美股开盘特斯拉股价应声走高，盘初涨至354.57美元，刷新2月27日以来盘中高位，日内涨超3.6%，显示投资者对马斯克继续领导公司的决心表示欢迎。早盘特斯拉回吐部分涨幅，涨不足2%，午盘曾逼近日高，后再度回吐涨幅，收涨约0.5%。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/aa872b75-80be-439f-a715-e82494ceb894.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="629" data-wscnw="870" data-wscnsize="34270"/></p>
<h2>淡化特斯拉面临的销售挑战</h2>
<p>去年，特斯拉录得十多年来首次年度汽车销量下滑，今年初再欧洲多国更是遭遇两位数的销售剧减。马斯克本周二却坚称，特斯拉已经&#34;扭转局面&#34;。</p>
<p>当被质疑特斯拉在欧洲主要电动车市场的销量持续下滑时，马斯克承认欧洲是公司销售最薄弱地区，但声称在其他地区表现强劲。他说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;目前我们的销售情况良好。我们预计不会出现明显的销售短缺。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这番乐观言论与市场现实形成鲜明对比，截至本周一收盘，特斯拉股价今年初以来已累跌约15%，反映了投资者对公司面临日益激烈的全球竞争的担忧。</p>
<h2>政治热情“退烧” 将大幅削减政治投入</h2>
<p>马斯克本周二表示，他将“大幅减少”未来的政治支出。被问及原因时，他简洁地回答：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;我认为我已经做得够多了。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>此后他还说：“如果我看到未来进行政治支出的理由，我会这样做。但目前我不认为有理由。”</p>
<p>评论认为，这一转变对特朗普及共和党可能是沉重打击，共和党很可能已将马斯克的慷慨解囊计入2026年中期选举的筹资计划中。媒体称，历史上美国总统所在的政党几乎总是在中期选举中失去众议院席位，预测市场给予特朗普政党在2026年后保持控制权的几率仅为五分之一。</p>
<p>去年美国大选期间，马斯克向各政治团体捐赠了约2.5亿美元，成为美国选举史上最大的单一捐赠者。他的大部分资金都用于支持特朗普。</p>
<h2>否认损害特斯拉形象 一些暴力抗议者该坐牢</h2>
<p>特朗普上任后，随着马斯克在共和党内的地位提升，特斯拉的多个展厅和公司充电站之类设施遭到袭击。马斯克周二表示，他确实将针对他的抗议活动视为针对个人的攻击，尤其是那些涉及人像悬挂和死亡威胁的行为：&#34;反对政治立场是可以的，但诉诸暴力、悬挂人像和死亡威胁是不可接受的。&#34;</p>
<p>面对批评者指责他的政治活动损害了特斯拉品牌，马斯克辩解称，虽然公司失去了一些政治上的左派消费者，但也赢得了右翼消费者。</p>
<p>马斯克严厉批评了抗议者对特斯拉采取的&#34;大规模暴力&#34;行为，认为一些抗议者该坐牢。他说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;他们站在了历史错误的一边，这是邪恶的行为。必须对他们采取行动，其中一些人将进监狱，他们罪有应得。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>星链可能上市</h2>
<p>除了特斯拉，马斯克还掌管SpaceX并拥有社交媒体平台X和神经科技初创公司Neuralink。本周二，马斯克暗示旗下卫星互联网服务“星链”（Starlink）可能未来独立：“星链未来可能会独立上市。”</p>
<p>这一消息可能会引起投资者对马斯克商业帝国新的增长点的兴趣，尤其是在特斯拉面临竞争压力之际。</p>
<p>总体而言，马斯克的这些声明似乎旨在安抚担忧他过度分散注意力的特斯拉投资者，同时也可能标志着他在政治领域采取更谨慎立场的转变。</p>
<h2>6月底Robotaxi登陆得州奥斯汀 无人类驾驶员 员工远程监控</h2>
<p>马斯克本周二还证实，特斯拉将于6月底在美国得州奥斯汀的街道上推出自动驾驶出租车Robotaxi。特斯拉计划，在奥斯汀首次亮相后，将Robotaxi推广到洛杉矶和旧金山。</p>
<p>马斯克表示，特斯拉将首先在奥斯汀推出约10 辆车的Robotaxi服务，如果顺利且没有事故发生，将迅速扩展到数千辆。该服务将采用Model Y 车型，配备即将推出的智能辅助系统FSD版本FSD Unsupervised。</p>
<p>马斯克说，“对我们来说，谨慎的做法是从少量（车）开始，确认一切进展顺利，然后再扩大规模。”</p>
<p>马斯克承诺，车内不会配备人类安全驾驶员，称特斯拉员工将远程监控车队，同时暗示，将限制Model Y的行驶范围。“我们将非常密切地关注汽车的运行情况，随着信心增强，这种监控需求将会减少。”</p>
<h2>xAI将继续向英伟达和AMD买芯片 将建100万GPU工厂</h2>
<p>马斯克周二预计，特斯拉和xAI将继续从英伟达和 AMD 购买芯片，可能也会向其他公司采购。</p>
<p>马斯克的AI公司xAI已在位于美国田纳西州孟菲斯的 Colossus 工厂安装了20万块 GPU。马斯克周二说，xAI 还计划在孟菲斯郊外建造一座能容纳100万块 GPU的工厂。他没有具体说明公司已经订购了多少芯片，以及预计何时安装。</p>
<p>马斯克提到，几年前，他预测，芯片将成为AI发展的制约因素。</p>
<p>谈到特斯拉的AI进展，马斯克称，特斯拉在纽约州的Dojo 超级计算机已经用于训练其Autopilot 和 Optimus 机器人系统。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  曾毓群：新能源汽车、换电生态进入爆发阶段，正研究零碳电网技术 
Description:  <p>5月20日，宁德时代在香港联交所主板正式挂牌上市，成为“A+H股”双重上市企业。港股上市首日股价表现亮眼，早盘一度上涨18%，最终收涨16.43%，报306.2港元。</p>
<p>但比涨幅更引人注目的，是这家全球电池巨头在新起点上主动做出的战略宣言。宁德时代董事长兼CEO曾毓群在上市现场表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“宁德时代不只是电池零部件制造商，我们是一家系统解决方案提供者，更致力于成为一家零碳科技公司。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>在港股上市仪式现场，曾毓群与副董事长周佳共同敲锣，他的一席话，揭示出宁德时代在激烈的全球新能源竞赛中，正从“产品驱动”向“系统驱动”转型，从电池制造商向零碳解决方案商全面升级。</p>
<h2>零碳是目标，更是路径</h2>
<p data-start="474" data-end="520">宁德时代的港股上市，并不只是一次资本运作，更是其全面融入全球能源转型趋势的重要一步。曾毓群指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="522" data-end="606">“港股上市，意味着我们更广泛融入全球资本市场，也是我们推动全球零碳经济的新起点。在全球新能源革命的大趋势下，零碳经济正在快速崛起。宁德时代将成为全球零碳经济的开拓者。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="522" data-end="606">他明确表示，公司已基本完成零碳科技布局，并从三大核心领域展开：</p>
<p data-start="522" data-end="606"><strong>一、全球零碳交通：打造全生命周期闭环生态</strong></p>
<p data-start="638" data-end="676">宁德时代首先发力的是万亿级零碳交通市场。新能源汽车、电动船舶、低空经济……这些正在爆发的新兴领域，正是宁德时代零碳技术应用的落地场景。</p>
<p data-start="638" data-end="676">曾毓群指出，当前全球交通体系正在重构，新能源汽车和换电生态已进入爆发阶段，电动船舶、低空经济等新业态也方兴未艾。</p>
<p data-start="678" data-end="798">面对这一万亿级市场机会，宁德时代早已开始布局。曾毓群介绍，宁德时代打造了全球最全面、最先进的产品矩阵，并以“车电分离”与“电池标准化”为核心，推动换电模式发展。同时，促进“交通网与能源网融合”，打造从电池制造、使用到回收的全生命周期零碳新业态。</p>
<p><strong>二、全球零碳电力：柔性电网与虚拟电厂并进</strong></p>
<p>除交通之外，零碳电力系统是宁德时代另一个战略重点。</p>
<p>曾毓群表示，零碳电力体系迎来了前所未有的机遇，也面临巨大挑战。今年4月发生的西班牙大停电暴露了当前电网柔性调控能力较弱、储能配备不足，尤其是缺乏构网型支撑等普遍问题：</p>

<p>“我们正在全力以赴地研究零碳电网技术，包括电力电子柔性调控虚拟电厂的技术，要打造出新型的零碳电力系统，让零碳科技惠及千家万户。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>据介绍，其储能系统（ESS）已作为独立事业部运营，并在2024年贡献了公司16%的营收，毛利率高达26.8%，高于主力动力电池业务的23.9%，展现出更强盈利能力。</p>
<p><strong>三、全球产业新能源化：零碳技术全链路延展</strong></p>
<p>除了交通和电力，宁德时代也在积极推动全球产业系统的新能源转型。</p>
<p>曾毓群特别强调了他对“零碳未来城市”的构想。他表示，未来世界会出现从零碳工厂开始，逐步延伸到整个城市的零排放体系。</p>
<p>为此，宁德时代正在与多个伙伴合作，包括知名白酒企业——贵州茅台，一起打造“零碳生态圈”。</p>
<h2>全球化加速，欧洲、北美同步推进</h2>
<p>宁德时代此次在香港募资达357亿港元（约46亿美元），是今年迄今全球规模最大的IPO。这笔资金将主要用于加速欧洲本地化扩张计划，包括在德国、匈牙利建设工厂，以实现本地化生产。宁德时代还与Stellantis达成协议，在西班牙建立合资公司，同时也正与另一家欧洲汽车制造商商谈设立第四座工厂。</p>
<p>此外，宁德时代还计划借助当前中美90天低关税窗口期，向美国出口更多的电动车电池和储能电池。他同时补充说，虽然希望中美之间的谈判能取得良好结果，但就算没有也影响不大，因为宁德时代在美国市场的销量本来也不多。所以这次出口机会只是“有更好，没有也无妨”。</p>
<p>此前5月12日，据<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">中美日内瓦经贸会谈联合声明</a>，美国和中国宣布暂时削减关税。</p>
<h2>宁德时代市值飙升，曾毓群成香港首富</h2>
<p>宁德时代在全球电动车电池行业仍处于领先地位，客户包括特斯拉、福特、大众、蔚来、小鹏等国内外一线品牌，市场占有率接近40%，是全球最大的电动车电池制造商。</p>
<p>宁德时代最初于2018年在深交所上市，当时估值约为85亿美元。此后股价一路上涨，截至本周二收盘，市值已达到约1660亿美元。</p>
<p>根据彭博亿万富翁指数，截至5月19日，宁德时代创始人曾毓群身价已达到394亿美元，成为香港首富。他是福建宁德人，出生在离公司总部一个小时车程的山村。尽管身为董事长，他表示自己仍然把大部分时间花在技术上。不过，他也透露自己有个浓厚的个人兴趣——农业，尤其是“垂直农业”。</p>
<p data-start="369" data-end="372">曾毓群表示：</p>
<blockquote data-start="374" data-end="446">
<p data-start="376" data-end="446">“我现在还处在构思阶段，宁德时代暂时没有农业项目，这是我自己的个人兴趣。”</p>
<p data-start="376" data-end="446">“因为一旦农业问题解决了，很多问题就都解决了。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="376" data-end="446">在农业梦想尚未实现之前，宁德时代仍会专注于绿色能源转型，比如继续为特斯拉在上海的新储能工厂（Megapack项目）供应电芯和电池包。</p>
<p data-start="376" data-end="446">虽然特斯拉仍是宁德时代最大客户，但曾毓群坦言，他和马斯克最近联系少了：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="376" data-end="446">“自从他搞了‘DOGE’计划后，我们就没怎么聊过了。我们上一次聊天是几个月前，那时还聊了一些技术问题。”</p>

Title:  苹果6月WWDC活动将发布新AI APP战略，让第三方开发者接入大语言模型 
Description:  <p><strong>周二，据媒体报道，苹果将于6月9日的全球开发者大会（WWDC）上发布新款AI APP战略，苹果计划让第三方开发者们接入大语言模型。</strong></p>
<p>据知情人士透露，苹果正准备允许第三方开发者使用其人工智能模型来编写软件，旨在激发新应用的开发，并增强其设备的吸引力。苹果公司正在开发一套软件开发工具包（SDK）和相关框架，从而让外部开发者能基于苹果公司用于苹果智能（Apple Intelligence）的大型语言模型来构建AI功能。</p>
<p>目前，Apple Intelligence已支持iOS和macOS中的一些功能，如通知摘要、文本编辑和基础图像生成。此次开放将允许开发者将这些技术集成到特定的功能或整个应用程序中。</p>
<p>起初，苹果将开放的是可在本地设备上运行的小型模型，而不是需要服务器支持的更强大的云端AI模型。</p>
<p>目前开发者能用的Apple Intelligence功能非常有限，仅支持部分通知摘要和优先级设定、Writing Tools、Genmoji和Image Playground应用，而他们无法直接使用苹果的基础模型Apple Foundation Models来开发自己的AI功能。</p>
<p>由于苹果未开放模型，开发者只能依赖第三方技术。尽管苹果提供了Core ML框架支持开源模型，也兼容谷歌的TensorFlow等系统，但仍不足以满足生成式AI的开发需求。</p>
<p data-start="24" data-end="144">苹果的APP商店上有一系列来自主要厂商的AI应用，包括ChatGPT、微软的Copilot、Anthropic的Claude、xAI的Grok和Perplexity。这些应用使用的都是它们各自开发的内部模型。</p>
<p data-start="146" data-end="262">苹果希望复制App Store早期的成功模式——当年苹果首次将内部技术和软件框架向开发者开放，从而推动了应用生态的大爆发。现在，苹果也打算通过开放自家AI模型，并简化其集成方式，把其操作系统打造成全球最大的AI软件平台。</p>
<p data-start="264" data-end="408">应用数量的激增也可能带来财务上的好处。苹果会从App内订阅收入中抽取分成。不过，App Store目前正面临全球各地监管机构的压力。上个月，美国一名法官裁定，苹果必须允许开发者引导用户前往网页完成购买，从而绕过苹果的分成系统。AI应用的激增有望缓解苹果因部分收入流失而带来的冲击。</p>
<p data-start="410" data-end="549">苹果此前计划为应用开发者推出一系列选项，包括一个名为“App Intents”的新版功能。该功能将允许用户通过Siri语音助手对应用内的功能实现更精细的控制。苹果打算最早在iOS 19发布周期中引入这项功能，该周期从今年9月开始，并将持续到2026年。</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence的推出经历了一些波折。此前，其新闻摘要功能曾因错误信息被媒体抨击，Genmoji生成的表情符号也常与苹果的广告展示相差甚远。较实用的功能如Writing Tools实际上依赖于OpenAI的ChatGPT。</p>
<p><strong>分析称，苹果的最新举措是其在生成式AI领域追赶并争取领先地位的重要一步。苹果公司在AI大潮中面临困局，其推出Apple Intelligence平台已有一年，但其初始功能使用率不高，且相较其他AI平台仍显薄弱。苹果希望通过向开发者开放底层技术，激发出更具吸引力的AI应用。</strong></p>
<p>苹果发言人对上述消息拒绝置评。</p>
<h2>WWDC大会亮点</h2>
<p>开发者计划预计将成为本次WWDC大会的亮点之一。此外，亮点还包括iPhone、iPad 和 Mac操作系统的大幅更新（代号“Solarium”），目标是让各平台界面更加统一和一致，借鉴Vision Pro的visionOS操作系统。</p>
<p>除了开放模型，苹果还计划推出AI驱动的电池管理模式，以及一款结合AI的健康应用，内含虚拟健康教练功能，软件部分预计于2026年推出。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  谷歌“背水一战”：I/O开发者大会来袭，AI叙事有望迎来转折？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">随着开发者大会的临近，所有目光都集中在谷歌身上，投资者屏息以待，迫切等待谷歌AI实力证明，期待股价迎来转机！</p>
<p dir="ltr">周二（5月20日至21日），谷歌公司将在加州山景城的海岸线圆形剧场举办2025年度Google I/O开发者大会。届时，Google将公布各项软件产品的进展情况，预览最新功能。</p>
<p dir="ltr">根据公开信息披露，谷歌预计将公布大量关于Android、Chrome、Google搜索、YouTube以及AI聊天机器人Gemini的消息，重头戏是Gemini 2.5的系统性展示和多平台布局。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Alphabet 的投资者正期待本周二开始的谷歌开发者大会(Google I/O)能够展示公司在人工智能领域的最新进展，以缓解市场对其长期市场主导地位面临威胁的担忧。在谷歌大举投资AI的同时，投资者越来越担心竞争对手正在蚕食其核心搜索业务。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>交易员们正屏息等待，希望这将成为改变市场对AI叙事认知的转折点。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">分析表示，在谷歌大举投资AI的同时，投资者越来越担心竞争对手正在蚕食其核心搜索业务。投资者急切期待谷歌能够通过这场大会证明自身在AI领域的实力，这场年度盛会可能成为谷歌股价命运的关键时刻。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>交易数据显示，围绕开发者大会的期权交易活动明显增加，市场预期这一事件可能引发股价波动。</strong>如果谷歌能够展示令人印象深刻的AI技术进展，可能会改变投资者对该公司在AI竞争中地位的看法，从而推动股价上涨。如果谷歌的AI展示不及市场预期，可能会进一步加深投资者对其在AI竞赛中落后的担忧。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Matrix Asset Advisors首席投资官David Katz表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>人们希望大会能提供强劲未来的路线图，因为目前每个人都在等待另一只鞋落地，并对任何负面消息都准备按下扳机，我认为谷歌实际比当前股价反映的情况要强，因此把负面情绪视为买入机会，但它确实在AI领域面临比传统搜索更多的逆风。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ai">AI竞争加剧对搜索构成威胁，投资者怎么样才会满意？</h2>
<p>Alphabet股价表现平平，年初迄今下跌了12%，而同期纳斯达克100指数同期上涨2%。目前Alphabet股票的市盈率为16.4倍，低于其10年平均20.5倍水平。该股票明显低于其他超大型科技股和纳斯达克100指数的26倍市盈率。</p>
<p>近期股价疲软部分源于苹果公司高管在法庭证词中表示，4月份在Safari网络浏览器上的搜索量首次下降。Alphabet对此表示异议，并指出将在I/O大会上分享最新创新以解决市场担忧。</p>
<p><strong>The Information上周报道称，Alphabet将在大会上推出一款用于软件开发的AI代理，以及类似Pinterest的功能，此外还有对其Gemini AI聊天机器人的其他更新。分析师们特别关注谷歌可能在大会上发布的AI新产品和服务，市场预计谷歌将展示新一代大语言模型Gemini的进展，以及AI功能如何集成到其搜索引擎、云服务和Android生态系统中。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Melius Research技术研究主管Ben Reitzes认为：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Alphabet肯定会在活动中强势出击，但是为了更加积极看待未来，我们需要看到证据表明Gemini能够被货币化以替代我们所知道的搜索。 该公司面临着失去年轻用户给OpenAI等公司的风险。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">伯恩斯坦分析师Mark Shmulik表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">鉴于我们现在已经掌握了最近的数据，例如付费点击增长放缓、 Safari搜索量22年来首次下降，以及ChatGPT和Meta AI的用户数量即将达到10亿，<strong>这一次，仅仅一个好故事可能不足以打动投资者。 </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FBB Capital Partners高级研究分析师兼资产配置策略师Michael Brenner表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>如果Alphabet能够在I/O大会上将其出色的技术、人才、数据和用户基础整合为一个引人注目的产品，将有明确的上升空间，</strong>该股票看起来确实很便宜，但它不是我们最大的超配仓位，因为围绕其最大业务存在这些疑问。果这些威胁不消散，就无法阻止市盈率进一步下跌。</p>

Title:  日本妥协了？报道：日本考虑接受美国调降关税，而非完全豁免 
Description:  <p data-start="34" data-end="119">日本或接受美国下调关税税率，以打破日美贸易谈判僵局。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119">5月20日周二，日本共同社援引参与谈判的未具名人士的话报道，日本正考虑接受美国下调关税税率，而非坚持要求美国完全取消关税，尤其是在汽车、钢铁和铝产品等重点产品上。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119">此前据<a href="https://tv.cctv.com/2025/05/04/VIDEDeBALozPVl0Dyg4pBjiS250504.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">央视新闻</a>，4月初，美国启动了第一轮对等关税措施，不仅征收10%的普遍关税，还对进口汽车零部件征收25%关税，导致全球化受到一定冲击。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119">消息公布后，美元兑日元走高，截至发稿几近持平，此前一度跌超0.5%。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/b9d94a3c-5d5c-40d7-87ac-73150e1e89d5.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="443" data-wscnw="845"/></p>
<h2 data-start="34" data-end="119">日本打算观察美方反应，慎重决定</h2>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119">在此前的谈判中，日方原本希望美方取消对汽车等的追加关税，但美国总统特朗普对于全面撤销关税持消极态度。美方一直拒绝撤销关税，并表示不打算将日本最关心的汽车、钢铁和铝制品附加关税纳入谈判范围，这让日本感到压力。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119"><strong>但另一方面，美国已经和中国、英国等国家达成了多项关税降低协议。</strong>此前5月12日，据<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">中美日内瓦经贸会谈联合声明</a>，美国和中国宣布暂时削减关税。据<a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=11576823799002941413&amp;t=1746716970351&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;share_to=copy_url&amp;track_id=2e524845-a004-470d-8474-21ff9b358ca5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">央视新闻</a>，当地时间5月8日，英国和美国就关税贸易协议条款达成一致。英国汽车出口至美国的关税将从27.5%降至10%。</p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119"><strong>为了打破当前日美谈判僵局，日本正在考虑接受降低关税税率作为一种妥协方案。不过，目前日本政府打算观察美国的反应，再做出慎重决定。日本经济再生担当大臣赤泽亮正预计将在美东时间23日出席第三轮日美部长级会谈，就相关议题与美方展开进一步磋商。</strong></p>
<p data-start="34" data-end="119">而且，美国和英国之间已经达成了一个“低关税额度”协议，允许在一定数量内低税率进口。<strong>这让日本看到希望，认为汽车也可能谈得下来。</strong>不过，日本每年向美国出口的汽车数量高达136万辆，是英国对美出口的13倍左右。所以，日本能从美方争取到多少让步，仍是个未知数。</p>
<p data-start="452" data-end="523"><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">高额关税已令日本车企压力倍增</a>。本田Q4营业利润同比暴跌超过70%，并预计2026财年营业利润同比下降近59%。日产则决定不发布2026年财年营业利润预测。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  净买入54亿！昨天，创纪录的美股散户拯救了市场 
Description:  <p>尽管穆迪下调美国信用评级引发市场抛售，但昨日（5月19日）美股和美债强劲反弹，主要得益于散户投资者创纪录的抄底买入。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/d661d8a2-8d44-4c94-9a1e-17be797e785e.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="365" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<p>根据摩根大通分析师Emma Wu的观察，截至美国东部时间中午12点30分，<strong>散户投资者净买入41亿美元，这是当日该时段有史以来最大规模的净买入，超过了11个标准差。</strong></p>
<p>美股散户交易量占总交易量的约36%，同样创下历史新高。<strong>全天收盘时，散户净买入额更是达到了惊人的54亿美元。</strong></p>
<p>野村证券分析师Charlie McElligott解释说，<strong>穆迪的降级不过是“纸上谈兵”，</strong>利率市场早已将美国财政赤字不可持续的问题纳入考量，这反映了美国两党在“财政挥霍”上的共识。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ddee4dd4-6cb0-4e18-84f7-d96906222475.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="257" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<h2>历史经验：股市或将跑输债券</h2>
<p>昨日最引人注目的交易来自美股的散户投资者。Fundstrat Capital的创始人Tom Lee表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“这次降级并没有太多新消息，更大的驱动因素是许多投资者仍在观望，所以任何回调都会引发抄底买入。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Siebert首席投资官Mark Malek也补充道：“目前，对错过反弹和后续行情的恐惧，强于对穆迪迟来的美国信用评级下调可能带来任何负面影响的担忧。”但他同时也警告说，如果贸易谈判出现问题，一切都可能功亏一篑。</p>
<p>然而，彭博宏观策略师Simon White提醒投资者，尽管股市可能从目前水平继续上涨，但历史数据显示，<strong>在美国政府债务前两次评级下调后的几个月里，股市表现均不及债券。</strong></p>
<p>分析显示，2011年，在债务上限谈判僵持到最后一刻时，股市已经开始下跌并跑输债券。标普下调评级后，股债比率在两到三个月内呈横向震荡并略微下行趋势，随后才开始复苏。而在2023年，股市在降级前一直上涨并跑赢债券，但降级后却出现抛售并落后于固定收益产品——这是一个明显的趋势转变。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/7c93bf6b-6baa-433d-84a8-731172f59419.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="319" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<h2>削减开支与经济衰退的悖论</h2>
<p>有分析认为，昨日股市和债券的价格走势揭示了更深层次的博弈，这也解释了为何市场对DOGE的削减开支的努力只有象征性的抵制。</p>
<p>摩根大通的分析显示，<strong>如果削减足够的开支——即使这些开支都是浪费和欺诈——最终也必然会导致经济衰退。</strong></p>
<p>财经播客zerohedge对此评价道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“这正是国会正在等待的，因为届时他们将利用“紧急情况”投票通过一项远超任何削减开支的更大规模支出方案。</p>
<p>马斯克试图精简政府的努力固然值得称赞，但最终决定结局的仍将是国会。而在此方面，一切都一如既往地保持现状。”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>散户“免疫力”十足，机构看好反弹</h2>
<p>因此，那些“逢低买入”的散户们，似乎比所谓的“聪明钱”更愿意接受这种习得性行为。Malek表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>股市的免疫力，就像一个人在经历疾病后获得的免疫力一样。</strong>市场在过去五年经历了如此多的极端情况，现在我们认为的‘普通感冒’，在十年前可能就是一场瘟疫。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>最后，摩根大通交易部门指出，昨日的价格走势并未改变其看涨的假设，也未改变他们认为许多投资者更倾向于在英伟达财报公布前保持多头或持平的看法。他们认为，<strong>无论是疲软的PMI初值数据，还是消费行业财报带来的任何疲软都应该被买入。</strong></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  零跑狂按加速键 
Description:  <p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #808080;"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f368a242-3fad-4f6b-a18f-e485c474ac51.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1765" data-wscnw="2560" data-wscnsize="612883"/></span></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #808080;">编辑 | 王小娟</span></p>
<p>未曾想，在汽车销售的淡季，零跑成了内卷竞争中的“局外人”。</p>
<p>5月19日晚，零跑刊出了今年Q1财报，当季收入同比近翻两倍突破百亿元；更令人意外的是，在需要促销的销售淡季，零跑整体毛利率竟呈现出环比改善趋势，达到了15%的历史新高。</p>
<p>具体拆解来看，零跑此次超预期的成绩，很重要的部分是来自于战略合作收入，大约确认了3亿元技术服务费，毛利润占2亿元左右。</p>
<p>因此，在一季度降价清理老款库存的情况下，零跑的总收入和毛利率出现了逆势上行；同时也因这笔收入，让销售结构下沉（B10+C10销售比重环比提升近12%，定价更高的C11、C16环比下滑7%）的零跑，单车均价上升了3000元，至11.4万元。</p>
<p>不过值得一提的是，去除合作影响后，零跑13.3%的实际毛利率表现仍然超预期，和上季度保持基本持平。这背后一面是规模效应的起效，一面是零跑持续进行的成本管理优化。可以说，零跑自身的盈利能力正在不断增强。</p>
<p>整体来看，零跑已连续3个季度超越市场预期，而从去年Q1到今年Q1，零跑在新能源车市占率呈现不断上升趋势。财报会上，零跑汽车副总裁李腾飞表示，今年将全力冲击50万-60万辆年销，毛利率10-12%，以及年度盈亏平衡的目标。</p>
<p>交付量跃升、盈利结构步入良性轨道。这意味着，在竞争进入深水区后，作为后浪玩家，零跑在比亚迪的优势价格带切出了属于自己的蛋糕，并且要先一步拿到决赛的入场券了。</p>
<p>在业内人士看来，在极致性价比产品定价下，特别是今年B系列车型配置低于C系情况下，零跑想要实现全年盈利，关键依赖成本控制能力和规模效应。</p>
<p>据李腾飞透露，LEAP3.5平台带来了30-40%的降本效应。所有改款车都将适配LEAP3.5，与B系列共摊成本。前期铺垫到位，接下来B系列能否接棒C系列，撑起零跑规模的大旗就将是重中之重。</p>
<p>对此，零跑给出了二季度13-14万辆的销量指引，相当于每月要卖4.3-4.7万台新车。值得一提的是，4月，零跑凭借4.1万台的交付量摘得新势力销冠。换而言之，零跑表现出了连续拿下“新造车月销冠军”的决心。</p>
<p>为了实现这一野心，零跑今年将甩出一系列产品牌，除了已经登台的中B10和B01外，B05预计将在8月底的成都车展亮相，并于第四季度交付；此外C系列车型将在6至7月份进行改款，以配置优化来增强同价位段竞争力；同时更大尺寸的D系列车型将在四季度亮相。</p>
<p>不止产品端，零跑在销售层面也在加速开疆拓土。</p>
<p>首先，按照计划，零跑今年的渠道目标是门店突破1000家，加快零跑中心店和城市展厅门店布局速度，进一步渗透核心汽车商圈。</p>
<p>更重要的是海外市场也将开始为零跑“养家”。2025年零跑原本预期的出海销量在5-6万台左右，由于前4个月已经完成了近1.4万辆，零跑上调出海销量目标至5万-8万辆。下半年零跑国际将投入更符合欧洲对于小车需求的B10、B01。</p>
<p>而目前零跑也在加紧布局海外渠道。</p>
<p>一季度零跑国际渠道数量500家，欧洲渠道环比净增加100家。有接近零跑的人士透露，其海外渠道投放速度非常之快，很可能会带动今年零跑出海销量超预期，尤其是利用Stellantis的知名度迅速打开市场，且B平台车型更适合欧洲市场需求的情况下。</p>
<p>背靠Stellantis，零跑将基于其马来西亚工厂在今年底实现C10的本地化组装项目；同时，其预计在明年年中实现欧洲本地化生产。随着C10、B10的全球化经验的积累，加之Stellantis向零跑输出的当地市场消费习惯等信息，零跑的全球化道路，或许要走得比大部分新造车品牌更快。</p>
<p>由此来看，零跑今年实现50-60万辆销售目标似乎没有难度。</p>
<p>不过，其中的小插曲是，由于电池产能问题，零跑今年肩负上量的B10近期排产交付受到影响。李腾飞表示，该问题将会在5月下旬得到解决，接下来B01的上市和交付过程中，将不会受到电池等零部件供应而影响产量。这将让B系列对零跑规模的贡献更大程度地释放。</p>
<p>在业内人士看来，随着B平台新车催化，以及与一汽在零部件供应、股权合作预期推动下，零跑市值至少有30%的增长空间。这意味着，这位新势力黑马冲上千亿身价指日可待。</p>
<p>或许，只要零跑能稳住自己的节奏，就将进一步锁定赢面。只是如今市场环境风谲云诡，面对竞争对手后续的步步紧逼，零跑不仅要稳更要加快巩固份额的速度。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  “垂直整合模式”摇摇欲坠，联合健康医疗帝国神话将终结？ 
Description:  <p>联合健康集团（UnitedHealth Group）长期以来凭借其垂直整合模式在医疗健康行业占据主导地位，但目前这种模式正成为其软肋。</p>
<p>医疗成本飙升、监管收紧和政治审查加剧，使得其股价今年下跌近40%，前CEO Brian Thompson被暗杀，现CEO Andrew Witty被迫离职。</p>
<p>投资者对联合健康持续超预期盈利的盲目信任已不复存在，估值溢价也随之消失。这个曾被视为医疗保健未来方向、并被同行效仿的战略，如今正面临最严峻的考验。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e26dcac1-cce3-48ed-9487-dd4ba6680956.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="644" data-wscnw="844"/></p>
<h2>联合健康昔日辉煌：垂直整合的成功秘诀</h2>
<p>多年来，联合健康集团一直是医疗健康行业的典范，<strong>其垂直整合模式——涵盖保险、医生、药房以及连接它们的软件——为其带来了多年的主导地位和超常增长。</strong></p>
<p>联合健康的业务流程涵盖<strong>保险业务（UnitedHealthcare）</strong>和<strong>健康服务业务（Optum）</strong>。保险业务通过向个人、雇主和政府提供健康保险产品收取保费，利用精算和数据驱动的风险评估设定保费，以覆盖赔付成本并盈利。</p>
<p>健康服务业务则包括OptumHealth（提供直接医疗服务和健康管理服务，按人头或服务收费）、OptumRx（作为药房福利管理者，管理处方药计划，与药厂谈判折扣并收取服务费）和OptumInsight（提供数据分析、IT解决方案和咨询服务，向医疗机构和保险公司收费）。这种战略，部分是为了应对《平价医疗法案》对保险公司利润的限制，即要求其至少将80%的收入用于医疗支出。</p>
<p><strong>该战略取得了丰厚回报，</strong>例如以128亿美元收购药品福利管理公司Catamaran，交易使得联合健康的盈利增长速度远超同行。2013年至2023年间，公司净收入从56亿美元增至220亿美元，股价回报率高达715%，远超标普500指数的158%。</p>
<h2>医保优势计划：盈利增长的关键引擎与争议焦点</h2>
<p>随着时间推移，联合健康开始面临多项争议，<strong>其中最突出的是医保优势计划（Medicare Advantage）的医疗成本问题。</strong></p>
<p>2025年第一季度，联合健康报告其医保优势计划的医疗成本远超预期，导致公司大幅下调全年盈利预期。该计划的盈利模式依赖于控制医疗支出，但高利用率直接导致医疗损失率上升，挤压了利润率。</p>
<p><strong>此外，联合健康还面临医保欺诈调查的争议。</strong>2025年5月14日，《华尔街日报》报道称，美国司法部正在对联合健康进行刑事调查，重点是其医保优势计划的计费操作，怀疑其通过夸大诊断以获取额外政府支付。</p>
<p>该媒体的调查发现，联合健康通过可疑诊断获得了数十亿美元的额外付款。只要Medicare Advantage项目保持高利润，联合健康在其中的主导地位，无论是作为保险公司还是通过Optum作为医疗服务提供商，都成为其竞争优势，并促使竞争对手效仿其垂直整合战略。</p>
<h2 id="e33db0b2">监管与成本的双重打击：利润空间被压缩</h2>
<p>然而，形势开始发生变化。</p>
<p><strong>在日益严格的审查下，拜登政府出台了政策调整，降低了保险公司的收费。</strong>这些变化恰逢医疗成本加速上涨，形成了一场挤压收入和利润的双重打击。整个行业都感受到了压力，Humana和CVS的股价去年因成本飙升、利润受挤压而暴跌。</p>
<p>起初，联合健康似乎相对受保护。但高企的医疗利用率也最终影响了它。由于联合健康不仅提供保险，还通过Optum运营诊所，<strong>当成本超出预期时，它会受到双重打击：作为保险公司，需要支付更多的索赔，并且作为提供商，需要承担更高的医疗服务成本。</strong></p>
<p>当监管削减了流经该系统的款项时，这种痛苦会进一步加剧。</p>
<p>过去，联合健康可以通过确保患者被编码为尽可能多的疾病来抵消利润压力。<strong>但随着新的限制措施到位，这一杠杆变得难以施展。</strong>TD Cowen分析师Ryan Langston指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“无法像行业其他公司那样擅长编码，这可能代表了联合健康历史竞争优势的潜在根本性损害。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>与此同时，<strong>联合健康用于控制成本的某些工具也可能有所放松。</strong>其保险部门利用人工智能分析和事前授权等工具来控制利用率。但这些工具也受到了日益加剧的政治审查。</p>
<h2>网络攻击与高层变动：外部冲击加剧内部危机</h2>
<p>2024年，联合健康在收购 Change Healthcare 两年后，发生了针对其的网络攻击事件，扰乱了医疗保健系统。 Andrew Witty被传唤到国会，议员们质疑联合健康的规模是否构成系统性风险。参议员Elizabeth Warren呼吁拆分该公司。 随之而来的是前CEO Brian Thompson被暗杀。 </p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/80fe854b-3dd2-4ed7-a060-273422aba6bf.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="434" data-wscnw="650"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">枪杀CEO Brian Thompson 的嫌疑人路易吉·曼吉奥内</span></p>
<p>此外，政治压力也在增加，联合健康开始放松其一些事先授权协议。 Witty承诺“加快Medicare Advantage患者的手术和服务批准时间”。 然而，一些分析师质疑，放松事先授权控制是否正在成为成本驱动因素。 Bernstein的分析师Lance Wilkes写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“UNH可能会放松事先授权和其他索赔控制，以应对政策压力。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>尽管经历了最近的动荡，联合健康仍然是行业巨头，拥有近40万名员工，为全美数百万美国人提供服务。然而，随着财务和政治压力的不断增加，该公司的巨大规模可能已成为一种负担，而非战略优势。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  中国4月黄金进口猛增73%，创11个月新高 
Description:  <p>尽管金价创历史新高，但中国4月黄金进口环比飙升73%，创近一年最高水平，央行为满足投资避险需求4月份向部分商业银行分配新进口配额。</p>
<p><strong>周二，海关数据显示，中国上月黄金进口总量达到127.5公吨，创下11个月来的新高，环比增幅高达73%。与此同时，铂金进口量也创新一年来最高，4月进口了11.5吨。</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/82725769-b82e-4a0b-ac61-1d249ae5b02e.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="353" data-wscnw="707" data-wscnsize="28451"/></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>图片来源：wind</strong></p>
<p>而这一增长发生在金价反复创下历史新高、甚至一度触及每盎司3500美元的背景下，这种逆势增长凸显了投资者对黄金的旺盛需求，即便在高价环境下，购买意愿依然强劲。</p>
<p><strong>4月份央行向部分商业银行分配新进口配额的举措，是推动进口激增的关键因素。值得注意的是，中国央行对实物黄金流动实施严格管控，通常仅向特定指定银行发放进口许可和配额。</strong></p>
<p>这一举措明显旨在回应贸易战期间机构投资者和散户对避险资产的强烈需求。国内投资者正大量转向黄金以对冲日益升级的地缘政治不确定性，这已成为推动今年早些时候黄金价格强劲上涨的重要动力。</p>
<p>虽然随着贸易局势可能缓解的希望升温，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746912?keyword=%E4%B8%AD%E7%BE%8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5月中美各取消了91%的加征关税</a>，金价出现了一定回落，但分析指出央行持续购买黄金以分散美元资产配置的战略举措预计将进一步支撑金价。</p>

Title:  美债大跌，银行“接盘”？ 
Description:  <p>近期美债大跌，30年期美债收益率昨日午后一度突破5%，10年期美债收益率再次来到4.5%关口。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/0a99bd36-1b1a-41f2-9698-1153e5ac2437.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="607" data-wscnw="905" data-wscnsize="51231"/></p>
<p>美债大跌引发业内对政府出手救市的预期，然而，银行担心，最终接盘的还是自己。周二，前贝莱德基金经理、资深华尔街投资人Edward Dowd表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“谁来买我们的国债？是我们自己……他们打算放松针对国债的SLR（补充杠杆率）监管，好让银行来接盘。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/288b8d14-75eb-4f0c-bf28-de0b923ac8b9.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="527" data-wscnw="599"/></p>
<p>据媒体此前报道，美国五名共和党议员致信美联储，呼吁调整监管，敦促美联储出手改善美债市场的流动性问题，并建议考虑“有针对性地”修改银行资本监管的规定，特别是涉及SLR的部分。</p>
<p>SLR是巴塞尔协议III的一部分，它的核心是银行必须为其全部资产（包括国债）预留一定比例的资本金，不能盲目扩张。如果银行囤太多国债，资本要求也会大幅上升，于是银行不愿意囤债、不积极买卖，影响了市场流动性。而对系统性重要的大型银行来说，还要遵守更严格的“增强版SLR”要求，使得问题更为突出。</p>
<p>美国国债市场规模庞大，目前已高达29万亿美元。最近几年，这个市场流动性有时会出问题，比如2020年疫情刚爆发那会儿，市场一度非常紧张，美联储不得不出手每天购买数十亿美元的美债来救场。</p>
<p>多位投资者和分析师认为，这类流动性紧张的背后，与SLR制度有关。美国部分国会议员呼吁美联储：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“我们建议美联储审慎评估是否可以进行有针对性的调整。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>美联储官方暂时没有表态。不过鲍威尔上个月在国会听证会中曾表示支持降低SLR，还说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“我确实预计我们会重新回到这个问题上来，跟其他机构的新同事们一起合作，把这事办成。”</p>

Description:  <p>得益于月活用户、月均付费用户、日均使用时长均创历史新高，B站Q1营收同比增24%。同时，广告与游戏等高利润率业务营收大增，带动B站毛利率升至36.3%，Q1经调整后净利润较去年一季度扭亏为盈，经营现金流实现翻倍。</p>
<p>5月20日，哔哩哔哩发布未经审计的2025年第一季度财报。</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Q1调整后每股收益0.86元人民币，去年同期亏损1.06元人民币。</p>
<p>Q1经调整净利润为3.62亿元，去年同期则为亏损4.56亿元。</p>
<p>Q1月活跃用户3.68亿，同比增长7.8%。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>哔哩哔哩美股盘前一度涨超4%，现涨幅收窄至逾2%。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/42ca331c-01db-4171-96dc-aedae28daf2b.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="439" data-wscnw="618" data-wscnsize="45278"/></p>
<h2>月均付费用户创新高，广告、游戏业务带动利润增长</h2>
<p>B站Q1营收同比增长24%至70.03亿元，经调整净利润为3.62亿元，去年同期则为亏损4.56亿元，实现扭亏为盈。</p>
<p>分业务看，B站四大收入来源呈现不同增长态势：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>增值服务：营收28.07亿元，同比增长11%，占总营收40%。</p>
<p>广告业务：营收19.98亿元，同比增长20%，占总营收28.5%。</p>
<p>手机游戏：营收17.31亿元，同比增长76%，占总营收24.7%。</p>
<p>IP衍生品及其他：营收4.67亿元，同比下降4%，占总营收6.8%。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>值得注意的是，游戏业务的突出表现主要来自独家授权游戏《三国：谋定天下》的强劲表现。游戏和广告业务毛利率通常高于增值服务，这一结构优化帮助B站整体毛利率提升。</p>
<p><strong>至于营收双位数增长的原因，CEO陈睿指出：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“B站用户基础及使用粘性继续增强。第一季度，日均活跃用户(DAU)达1.067亿，同比增长约4.2%；月活用户(MAU)创历史新高达3.68亿。<strong>更重要的是，月均付费用户达3200万，创下历史新高，表明用户付费意愿增强。</strong></p>
<p>日均使用时长达108分钟的新高，显示用户粘性增强。同时，用户群体渐趋成熟，2025年用户平均年龄达26岁，这一群体通常拥有更强的消费能力。</p>
<p>随着用户价值的提升和商业化效率的提升，我们第一季度的总净收入同比增长24%，达到人民币70亿元。</p>
<p>2025年我们以强劲的财务表现和健康的社区生态指标实现了开门红...我们将乘势而上，通过提供更高效、更优质的商业化解决方案持续释放社区潜力。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>至于净利润扭亏为盈的原因，CFO樊欣指出：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“第一季度，我们加速了收入增长并提升了利润率。<strong>这得益于我们高利润率的广告和游戏业务的出色表现，这两个业务营收分别同比增长20%和76%。</strong>毛利润同比增长58%，毛利率从去年同期的28.3%上升至36.3%。</p>
<p>在强劲的收入和利润率增长的支撑下，我们实现了调整后净利润3.615亿元人民币。我们良性的运营周期继续推动强劲的经营现金流，本季度创造了13亿元人民币的现金流。</p>
<p>展望未来，我们将继续专注于盈利增长，通过高效、可持续的运营扩大业务规模和社区规模，并为股东创造长期价值。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>成本管控方面，虽然总营收增长24%，但营业成本仅增长10%，远低于营收增速。其中，研发开支同比下降13%，体现了运营效率的提升。销售及营销开支同比增加26%，主要是由于春节联欢晚会独家弹幕直播的一次性营销开支以及《三国：谋定天下》的推广开支。</p>
<p><strong>公司经营现金流达13.02亿元，较去年同期的6.38亿元翻了一倍多</strong>，显示业务运营逐渐步入良性循环。截至2025年3月底，B站持有现金、现金等价物、定期存款及短期投资总计173.97亿元(23.97亿美元)，财务状况稳健。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  玻尿酸被资本抹黑？昔日千亿医美巨头回应“炮轰券商”事件 
Description:  <p>玻尿酸巨头华熙生物近期向券商“开炮”，揭开了医美行业“热点轮动”的一角！</p>
<p>针对突然向券商“开炮”，周二华熙生物对每经作出最新回应，华熙生物表示，透明质酸产业一直希望其作为行业龙头带头发声，纠正对透明质酸的罔顾科学的踩踏和抹黑。此次发声是基于多重考虑，且已和两大行业协会沟通并获得支持。</p>
<p>这一回应针对华熙生物5月17日在微信公众号发布的长文，其在文中驳斥了“玻尿酸过时”的观点，并点名了多家券商炒作“重组胶原蛋白”，与玻尿酸进行恶意对比。</p>
<p>“炮轰”的背后隐藏着华熙生物的困境，随着玻尿酸产能过剩价格不断下降，行业竞争也在不断加剧，华熙生物的业绩已经开始失速，2024年扣非净利缩水78.13%，市值也较巅峰缩水超1000亿。</p>
<p>反观，重组胶原蛋白成为市场的“新宠”，行业中巨子生物司股价一路走高，其业绩上完成了对华熙生物的反超，2024年归母净利润仅为巨子生物净利润的十二分之一左右。</p>
<h2>华熙生物发长文“<strong>开撕”券商</strong></h2>
<p>5月17日晚间，华熙生物在其官方微信号发布《概念总在重演，科技永远向前》的文章，点名批评多家券商的研究报告，认为这些报告通过“对比研究”的方式，试图抹黑透明质酸（即玻尿酸），从而抬高重组胶原蛋白的市场地位。</p>
<p>华熙生物直接在文章中点名几家券商机构称：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2022年开始，随着资本市场不断追求新的公司题材，重组胶原蛋白概念被看似幸运地选中了。为了营造比透明质酸产业更大的预期，围绕某重组胶原企业的研报中，出现了大量直接针对中国透明质酸产业的所谓“对比研究”。这些误导性“结论”伴随着随后兴起的“玻尿酸过时论”被媒体和自媒体红人广泛传播，形成了资本市场与消费市场的舆论共振。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/254cd688-67b3-48e1-81a6-e4423dc2cba4.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="663" data-wscnw="697" data-wscnsize="91755"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>华熙生物认为，透明质酸“过时论”的兴起，本质上是一场由“浮躁资本”构建的题材幻象，试图用“神话过时”绕开中国产业发展必然面临的进阶过程，引导资本和市场资源聚焦于资本新题材，用“新贵登场”塑造沙土高楼。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="ab479bc4">“炮轰”背后：华熙生物的困境与反击</h2>
</div>
<p>然而，这背后也隐藏着华熙生物的困境。</p>
<p>随着玻尿酸量产技术的成熟，产能早已过剩，价格也在不断下降。据媒体报道，玻尿酸原料价格平均每年下降约5%。越来越多的玩家涌入玻尿酸市场，行业竞争日益加剧。</p>
<p>这种背景下，华熙生物曾经辉煌的玻尿酸业务面临严峻挑战，这已经体现在了业绩上。</p>
<p>2024年，华熙生物营业收入同比下降11.61%，归母净利润暴跌70.59%，仅为1.74亿元，创下上市以来最差纪录。 2025年一季度，营收再次下降20.77%，归母净利润下降58.15%，延续了颓势。</p>
<p>在资本市场上，玻尿酸概念股的表现也不尽如人意。昊海生科、华熙生物和爱美客在2021年7月之后，股价均出现大幅下跌。2021年巅峰时的华熙生物市值曾超1400亿，但截至5月20日收盘，股价为53.08元/股，市值为255.67亿。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/fcfce13a-bc3b-4fd0-b728-d4a7b6db08bd.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="474" data-wscnw="589" data-wscnsize="46584"/></p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="580eeac1">资本市场的“新宠”：重组胶原蛋白的崛起</h2>
<p>同处医美赛道，玻尿酸和重组胶原蛋白均为具有填充、修复功能的生物材料。过去几年，玻尿酸行业竞争加剧，利润空间被压缩。而重组胶原蛋白凭借其独特的优势，成为资本市场的新宠。</p>
<p>A股“重组蛋白”概念股巨子生物和锦波生物表现强势，股价持续上涨。截至5月20日收盘，巨子生物的股价收于84.85港元/股，较其发行价上涨超200%，总市值为908亿港元。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/d34504f2-4e83-425b-a4ab-044f2421c018.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="471" data-wscnw="596" data-wscnsize="47083"/></p>

<p>两家公司的业绩也保持高速增长势头。2022年至2024年期间，巨子生物的营业收入分别为26.59亿元、38.91亿元、59.81亿元；净利润分别为11.22亿元、16.02亿元、22.27亿元。</p>

</blockquote>
<p>小马智行联合创始人、CEO彭军表示，2025年是小马智行的Robotaxi量产之年，<strong>随着第七代Robotaxi的自动驾驶系统成本下降，再加上生产提速，2025年底Robotaxi车队规模将扩大到千台。</strong></p>
<p>美股盘前，小马智行涨超17%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/dc3a8759-eb8c-49a9-b49d-830be8f8d1cc.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="660" data-wscnw="844"/></p>
<h2>Robotaxi同比增长200%，车队规模年底达千台</h2>
<p>第一季度，Robotaxi业务收入达1230万元（173万美元），同比增长200%，是一季度营收保持同比增长的主要原因。<strong>Robotaxi业务收入主要来源两类：乘客车费收入和技术解决方案项目收入。一季度乘客车费收入增幅明显，同比增长800%。</strong>车规级硬件等的加持，小马智行显著降低了第七代平台的硬件成本，再加上自动驾驶车队运营目前已高度自动化，提升了运营效率，也降低了运营成本。</p>
<p>第七代Robotaxi是小马智行迈向量产的里程碑。目前，小马智行正携手丰田、北汽、广汽三家车企，建立了密切的战略合作关系，七代Robotaxi带来了多方面的优势，包括：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>安全性和可靠性提升。</li>
<li>采用 100% 车规级自动驾驶套件。</li>
<li>相比上一代系统，BOM 成本降低 70%。</li>
<li>预计从 2025 年年中开始量产。</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>长远来看，第七代Robotaxi量产能为小马智行带来更大收益，但在短期内研发费用有所增加。</p>
<p>2025年第一季度，小马智行经调整研发费用为2.95亿元（4058万美元），同比增长38%。小马智行CFO王皓俊表示，2025年是Robotaxi扩大规模的关键一年，小马智行将在加大核心业务投入的同时进一步提升资金使用效率，以推动未来增长，并构建长期可持续的盈利模式。</p>
<h2>未来展望：扩大商业化区域，加强战略合作</h2>
<p>展望未来，小马智行正在积极推进其商业化战略：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>扩大商业化区域，目前已覆盖北京、广州、深圳和上海，总面积超过 2000 平方公里。</li>
<li>获得深圳首个全无人驾驶 Robotaxi 牌照，具有里程碑意义。</li>
<li>与 Uber 合作，计划在中东地区推出 Robotaxi 服务，并拓展至其他国际市场。</li>
<li>与 ComfortDelGro 合作，在新加坡进行 Robotaxi 试点项目。</li>

Title:  央行撤退，大行观望，日本国债无人接盘！ 
Description:  <p>在日本国债拍卖需求创下十多年来的新低之际，瑞穗金融集团（Mizuho Financial Group）<strong>正在采取“非常保守”的证券投资策略，大幅削减债券持仓，</strong>等待日本央行加息政策进一步明朗。</p>
<p>瑞穗首席执行官 Masahiro Kihara 在周二的新闻发布会上表示，<strong>在确信日本央行不会进一步加息之前，该行不会建立大规模的投资头寸。</strong></p>
<p>投资者报告显示，瑞穗已经削减了其在日本和外国政府债券中的头寸。<strong>截至今年3月，其持有的日本国债从三年前的25.1万亿日元锐减至8.3万亿日元（约合570亿美元）。</strong></p>
<p>虽然同期其外国债券持仓从8.9万亿日元增加到11.8万亿日元，但由于该行已经意识到损失，其外国债券持仓较去年有所下降。</p>
<p>目前，日本央行正在努力微调其量化紧缩进程，市场参与者内部对何时加快或减缓购债节奏众说纷纣。而瑞穗的谨慎策略或预示着未来一段时间内市场将维持谨慎情绪。</p>
<h2>瑞穗谨慎布局：债券持仓大瘦身，静待日央行政策明朗</h2>
<p>Kihara 的言论发布之际，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">日本20年期国债迎来自2012年以来最差拍卖</a>，投标倍数跌至2.5倍，尾差飙升至1987年以来最高水平。截至上个月底，日本央行持有的长期政府债务为576.6万亿日元，仅比2024年7月底（即开始放缓债券购买速度之前）下降了2.2%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/03582fbb-1932-499b-9bce-887002f8111b.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="467" data-wscnw="844"/></p>
<p>消息导致日本国债周二进一步下跌。其中，日本20年期国债收益率飙升约15个基点，达到2000年以来最高，而30年期债券收益率则升至1999年首次发行该品种债券以来最高。</p>
<p><img src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/13837aba-f174-4c81-84b5-120c24a96bc9.png"/></p>
<p>然而，这些市场波动对瑞穗和其他商业银行的影响可能不大，因为他们倾向于购买期限短于10年的债券。<strong>瑞穗在简报中表示，其持有的日本国债的平均剩余期限为一年，外国债券的平均剩余期限为两年。</strong></p>
<p>除了债券市场，瑞穗还宣布计划在截至2028年3月的三年内出售至少价值3500亿日元的“战略”持股，即为巩固与企业客户关系的股票。</p>
<p>Kihara表示，<strong>瑞穗不太可能在美国进行投资银行业务交易。</strong>该行于2023年收购了纽约精品咨询公司 Greenhill &amp; Co.，Kihara 认为该行已经在此领域建立了足够的产品。特别值得注意的是，穆迪上周五下调美国信用评级，从Aaa降至Aa1，进一步放大了全球债券市场的不确定性。</p>
<p>此外，据 Kihara 称，瑞穗也不太热衷于亚洲的传统零售银行业务。</p>
<h2>日本债券市场动荡，长期债券承压</h2>
<p>目前，<strong>日本央行正在努力微调其量化紧缩进程，市场参与者内部对何时加快或减缓购债节奏众说纷纣。</strong></p>
<p>一些人认为央行应加快削减购债，理由是过一半的日本国债由日本央行持有，以及由此对收益率曲线造成的扭曲。而另一些则强调应放慢节奏，担忧快速收紧可能会加剧市场流动性紧张。</p>
<p>关于最终的购债规模，市场也存在广泛的看法。一些人认为央行最终应完全停止购买债券，而另一些人则认为每月应购买1万亿日元（约合69亿美元）至2万亿日元，还有人建议维持在3万亿日元左右。</p>
<p>日本央行正在与来自银行、证券公司和人寿保险公司等的代表举行听证会，就缩减购债的步伐征询意见。<strong>预计央行将在6月17日结束的董事会会议上更新其在市场中减少影响力的计划。</strong></p>

Title:  美国生物医药“三座大山”压顶：关税、药价、专利悬崖 
Description:  <p>近期，美国大型生物制药板块经历了一场显著的“倒春寒”。自2025年4月2日一项关键的关税声明发布以来，该板块表现大幅跑输标普500指数约15个百分点，市场情绪趋于谨慎。</p>
<p>行业似乎正笼罩在关税壁垒高筑、药价谈判压力以及迫在眉睫的专利悬崖等多重阴霾之下，前景显得扑朔迷离。</p>
<h2><strong>阴霾笼罩——压制板块表现的“三座大山”</strong></h2>
<p>生物医药，这个曾经群星璀璨的板块，如今正面临前所未有的挑战。摩根大通的分析师们将这些挑战归纳为几个核心“悬顶因素”（overhangs）。</p>
<p>而早在2023年5月，美国外交关系协会高级研究员Brad W. Setser在美国参议院财政委员会的证词中，就已深刻揭示了美国制药公司通过复杂的税务结构和生产布局来规避本土高额税负的现象，这些深层结构性问题与当前板块面临的压力不无关联。</p>
<p><strong>第一座山：关税阴云与供应链挑战</strong></p>
<p>行业特定的关税政策无疑是近期板块下行的直接导火索。</p>
<p>这些政策细节尚未完全披露，给市场带来了巨大的不确定性。然而，摩根大通认为，关税的冲击在很大程度上是“可控的”。</p>
<p>短期内，企业可以通过积极的库存管理、加速产品运往美国等方式来应对。从中长期来看，通过制造业回流，包括利用内部产能和拓展第三方合作关系，能够有效管理关税带来的风险敞口。</p>
<p>尽管摩根大通预计企业在2026至2027年的损益表可能会因此受到一定影响，例如目前约16-17%的税率可能向吉利德科学（GILD）那样主要依赖美国本土生产和知识产权的19-20%税率靠拢，但这并不构成投资者需要完全规避该行业的根本理由。</p>
<p>值得注意的是，Setser在其证词中指出，美国税法（尤其在2017年《减税与就业法案》(TCJA)之后）的结构性缺陷，客观上鼓励了美国公司将利润和生产转移至海外低税率地区。</p>
<p>例如，GILTI（全球无形低税收入）税制中对海外有形资产的“推定回报”予以豁免，进一步刺激了企业在海外配置生产设施以降低全球税负。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/8ce72317-9908-4162-a0e8-e425b7317270.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="847" data-wscnw="1213"/></p>
<p>这导致美国从爱尔兰、瑞士、新加坡等以低税率吸引制药企业的热点地区大量进口药品，而这些策略本质上是为了税收优化。这种长期的离岸生产布局，也使得板块在面临新的关税政策时显得更为脆弱。</p>
<p><strong>第二座山：药价谈判——MFN与IRA的双重压力</strong></p>
<p>药价问题始终是悬在生物医药板块头上的达摩克利斯之剑。其中，“最惠国”（MFN）参考定价的幽灵不时搅动市场情绪。</p>
<p>但摩根大通对此持谨慎乐观态度，认为MFN政策若想广泛推行，不仅需要获得国会的明确批准（而共和党对此支持寥寥），还可能面临诸多法律层面的挑战。</p>
<p>即便政府试图通过现有IRA（通胀削减法案）的框架小规模引入MFN原则，其影响也可能被IRA中针对所谓“药丸罚款”（Pill Penalty，指对某些口服药物的惩罚性定价条款）的潜在取消所抵消，并且当前估值已在一定程度上反映了这些担忧。</p>
<p>至于IRA法案本身带来的药品价格谈判，摩根大通认为其对市场预期的冲击更多是“增量”而非“颠覆性”的。</p>
<p>市场对于2027年谈判药品（预计2025年11月30日前公布最高公平价格MFPs）将面临比2026年清单（当时实现了约20-25%的净价削减）更大折扣已有预期，部分分析甚至已计入了35-50%的价格下调。</p>
<p>而美国医保和医助服务中心（CMS）近期关于2028年谈判可能将某些皮下注射产品（如Keytruda、Opdivo的皮下剂型）与其静脉注射剂型捆绑的指导意见，在摩根大通看来，市场早已预料到这些产品无论如何都将面临生物类似药的激烈价格竞争，因此IRA的纳入并不会带来额外的大幅震动。</p>
<p>Setser的证词为理解药价压力提供了更深层的视角。</p>
<p>他强调，尽管美国药品价格全球最高，但许多美国大型制药公司通过利润转移，仅在美国报告极少的利润，而在海外（通常是低税率国家）报告巨额利润。</p>
<p>例如，2022年，Setser援引数据显示，（剔除吉利德和礼来后）几家主要美国上市药企在美国本土的2140亿美元营收中仅录得约100亿美元利润，而在海外1710亿美元营收中却斩获超900亿美元利润。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/cbcaae70-aa0f-4ce8-b194-e57707bdf01f.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1454" data-wscnw="1070"/></p>
<p>这种利润与销售地点的显著错位，正是通过复杂的知识产权转移和离岸生产实现的，其核心目的之一便是规避美国本土相对较高的税率和药价体系的全面冲击。</p>
<p><strong>第三座山：专利悬崖——无法回避的周期性阵痛</strong></p>
<p>对于投资者而言，2028年至2030年间一批重磅药物（如Keytruda、Opdivo、Eliquis等）的专利到期，无疑是长期压制板块估值的重要因素。</p>
<p>然而，这更像是一场可预见的“盈利重置”（rebase），而非板块性的“断崖式危机”。</p>
<p>预计即使是受影响最直接的公司，如百时美施贵宝（BMY）和默沙东（MRK），其每股收益（EPS）的调整幅度也可能在15-20%或更低的水平。</p>
<p>与此同时，礼来（LLY）、吉利德科学（GILD）、强生（JNJ）、艾伯维（ABBV）等一批公司，其下一轮主要的专利到期潮（LOEs）要到2030年代中期甚至更晚才会到来。</p>
<p>回顾历史，大型专利到期事件通常是行业可以消化和管理的，LOE后一年平均EPS的侵蚀幅度约为15%，随后往往能迅速反弹，并伴随着市盈率的扩张。<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>估值探底——历史性低谷中寻觅“黄金坑”？</strong></h2>
<p>在多重压力的交织下，美国大型生物制药板块的估值已悄然滑落至历史性的洼地。摩根大通指出，经历了近期的回调后，该板块（剔除礼来）目前相对标普500指数的估值折价已达到惊人的45-50%。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/3ea36022-af75-441f-9064-a0d870959af2.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="466" data-wscnw="854"/></p>
<p><em>图表说明：该图表展示了过去十余年间，美国大型生物制药板块（剔除礼来）的远期12个月市盈率（P/E）与标普500指数P/E的对比，以及两者之间的折价百分比。当前折价已触及历史低点。</em></p>
<p>摩根大通的分析师们认为，如此之深的折价，意味着市场当前的股价已计入了相当程度的政策风险，甚至可能是对关税、MFN以及IRA等不利因素的“近乎最坏情况”的定价。这种过度悲观的情绪，反而可能为板块的价值修复创造了空间。</p>
<p>从板块表现来看，自2025年4月2日关税消息落地后，生物制药板块整体下跌约8%，而同期标普500指数上涨约5%，其他防御性板块如消费必需品和公用事业也分别录得约2%和4%的正增长。</p>
<p><strong><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a778e211-75ec-4dbd-ad6c-4841b853cab4.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="298" data-wscnw="502"/></strong></p>
<p><em>图表说明：该图表展示了自2025年4月3日关税声明以来，美国大型生物制药板块与标普500指数、科技股、公用事业、消费必需品等其他板块的表现对比。生物制药板块显著落后。</em></p>

<h2><strong>重振之路——哪些催化剂能让板块“王者归来”？</strong></h2>
<p>在估值触底、悲观情绪弥漫之际，市场也在苦苦寻觅能够引领板块走出泥潭的催化剂。摩根大通认为，以下几个方面的积极变化，有望为板块注入新的活力：</p>
<p><strong>政策清晰化是关键</strong>：当前，无论是关税、MFN还是IRA的后续执行，许多政策仍停留在方向性指导层面，缺乏具体的实施细节，这使得投资者在“信息真空”中犹豫不前。</p>
<p>一旦这些政策的细节（如关税的确切税率、MFN的适用范围、IRA谈判的具体药品清单和降价幅度）得以明朗，将有助于投资者更准确地评估其实际影响。而这种影响，很可能没有市场当前所担心的那般可怕。</p>
<p>例如，近期可能宣布的针对制药业特定关税的232调查结果，若最终税率如市场基线预期的25%左右，摩根大通认为这将是行业高度可控的，反而能有效缓解投资者的焦虑情绪。</p>
<p>此外，对预算和解法案中关于MFN政策（如确认国会无进一步扩大行动）和IRA“药丸罚款”（如能取消，对板块是重大利好）的关注也至关重要。</p>
<p>从更宏观的政策层面看，Setser在其证词中提出了一系列旨在修正美国税法，以减少利润和生产外流的改革建议。</p>
<p>这些建议包括提高美国公司全球无形收入的税率至至少15%（与OECD全球最低税负协议对接），按国别计算GILTI税，以及强化原有的Subpart F条款，对海外特许权使用费收入按美国税率征税，取消对“成本分摊协议”的特殊税收待遇等。</p>
<p>虽然这些是更长期的结构性改革，但任何朝向这个方向的政策调整，都可能从根本上改变药企的生产和利润布局，对板块产生深远影响。</p>
<h2><strong>结论：于迷雾中寻找航向</strong></h2>
<p>综上所述，美国大型生物制药板块当前无疑正经历一段艰难时期。关税威胁、药价压力以及专利到期等“悬顶之剑”共同构成了压制市场情绪和板块估值的主要因素。</p>
<p>然而，这些挑战在很大程度上或是可以被行业主动管理和消化的（如通过生产回流应对关税，或凭借管线创新平滑专利到期影响），或是其负面冲击已在股价中得到了较为充分甚至过度的反映。</p>
<p>Setser的证词则从更深层次揭示了美国税收政策如何长期塑造了制药行业的全球生产和利润布局模式，这些模式在面临新的政策冲击时，既是脆弱点，也可能是企业战略调整的考量点。他甚至不无尖锐地指出2017年的《减税与就业法案》在某种程度上可以被称为“制药业减税与爱尔兰就业法案”，突显了税收政策对产业外移的深远影响。</p>
<p>未来，政策的逐步明朗化、IRA中不利条款（如“药丸罚款”）的潜在移除，以及市场风险偏好的转变，都有可能成为驱动板块反弹的强力催化剂。</p>
<p>在这样的背景下，投资者或许不应被短期的悲观情绪所裹挟，而更应聚焦于那些拥有强大研发实力、稳健财务状况、清晰增长路径的低估公司。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  资金涌入关税避风港，这个新兴国家股市今年飙涨28%！ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">波兰领跑新兴市场下一轮大牛市？</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">数据显示，<strong>波兰主要股指WIG今年已上涨28.6%，远超标普500仅1%的累计涨幅，成为今年全球表现最强劲的市场之一。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/7418d459-24a2-4cb8-a2b8-673f3192942e.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="397" data-wscnw="865"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">分析指出，<strong>波兰股市的强劲表现部分归功于该国相对独立于全球贸易战的地位，以及预期从德国巨额财政刺激计划中获益。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Warsaw研究所的首席执行官Tomasz Bardziłowski表示，这波涨势由“大量外资流入”推动，受益于波兰健康的经济以及股市不断上升的股息和相对较低的估值。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bardziłowski指出，当前波兰股票的市盈率比MSCI新兴市场指数低15%。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美国贸易战推升“和平交易”、经济增长仍具韧性</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">4月以来，<strong>特朗普发动的贸易战实际上转移了资本流向，从美国转向波兰和拉丁美洲部分国家等受关税影响较小的新兴市场。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">波兰VeloBank首席经济学家Piotr Arak指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“市场规模足够小，外国资本流动能产生明显影响。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">其次，波兰本国的经济增长也显现出强劲韧性。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">欧盟统计局的数据显示，波兰经济在2025年第一季度同比增长3.8%，是欧盟增长第二快的国家（仅次于爱尔兰），远高于欧盟1.4%的平均水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">分析师预计，2025年华沙证交所上市公司的每股收益平均将增长约10%。其中，占WIG指数40%权重的金融服务公司，本季度在创纪录盈利后正在提高股息。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">欧洲复兴开发银行(EBRD)首席经济学家Beata Javorcik表示，波兰在这些动荡时期保持韧性，“<strong>要归功于其多元化经济、庞大的国内市场以及有限的对美直接贸易敞口”。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>欧盟资金释放提供额外推力，关注6月总统决选</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，波兰总理图斯克（Donald Tusk）及其亲欧盟联盟回归后，解锁了之前冻结的数十亿欧元欧盟资金。这些资金主要用于基础设施和能源转型项目，政府正在部署这些资金，寻求摆脱对煤炭的依赖。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">受到这些举措的推动，<strong>波兰国有能源集团股价飙升，石油公司Orlen上涨53%，公用事业公司PGE今年以来上涨56%。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>投资者目前正密切关注将于6月1日开展的总统决选。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">目前，执政党候选人Rafał Trzaskowski正与反对派法律与公正党（PiS）的Karol Nawrocki之间展开出人意料的激烈竞争。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">波兰最大的银行PKO BP的首席经济学家Piotr Bujak表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“如果图斯克所属党派的候选人获胜，将有利于投资者对波兰资产的信心，而失败则可能引发人们对波兰是否会继续走改革道路的新担忧。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">新兴市场投资机会显现，波兰或仅是开始</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">波兰的案例可能只是新兴市场崛起的开端。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">随着美元走弱预期增强、美国债券收益率可能已触顶以及市场对中国经济复苏的期待，新兴市场正重新成为全球投资者关注的焦点。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747364">美银策略师Michael Hartnett的观察</a>，2025年迄今，不仅波兰股市成为表现最佳的股票市场，而且：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">年内表现最差资产：石油(-12%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">年内表现最佳资产：黄金(21%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">年内表现最佳货币：俄罗斯卢布(41%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">特拉维夫和德黑兰证券交易所都创下历史新高</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hartnett据此得出结论，今年地缘政治将驱动市场，而“和平交易”将在2025年跑赢“战争交易”。而在这样的环境下，<strong>“没有什么会比新兴市场股票表现得更好”。</strong></p>

Title:  被降级后，美国面临二选一：要么减税缩水，要么加重关税？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">穆迪美国信用降级敲响警钟，美国面临要么减税缩水，要么加重关税的两难局面。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，美国银行在最新的报告中表示，市场对美债的担忧已持续一段时间，穆迪的此次降级的时机也并非巧合，意在提醒美国政府关税收入将无法完全抵消拟减税成本。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尽管如此，但美银表示，美国或可能执意而行：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">从我们的观点看，更可能的情况是我们仍将获得一个扩张性的税收方案，长期美债收益率应该会继续反映对财政前景的担忧。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">风险在于：当华盛顿认真对待美国财政问题时，关税可能是唯一能有效减少赤字的手段，而另一轮大规模关税上调可能比不那么扩张的财政方案对经济造成更大伤害。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">降级时机绝非巧合</h2>
<p>美银表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>近期，许多客户询问债券市场是否即将到达投资者对债务可持续性担忧爆发的临界点。穆迪在周五晚间将美国评级从Aaa下调至Aa1后，这个问题变得尤为突出。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">从我们的角度来看，此次降级的时机并非巧合。在减税和关税政策悬而未决之际，穆迪似乎在传递一个信息：它认为这些政策变化将使美国的财政轨迹进一步恶化。具体而言，关税收入将无法完全抵消拟议中税法案的成本。我们对此表示认同。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">由于这并非新鲜事，截止目前市场反应较为温和。美银策略师预计，由于评级下调不会导致美债被排除在任何主要固定收益指数之外，因此不会引发被动抛售美国国债。然而，由于财政状况持续恶化，他们对长期美债持负面看法。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">更负责任的财政措施 or 扩张性税收政策+关税</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">现在的问题是，这次降级是否会促使国会共和党人转向更具财政责任感的方案，包括减少或推迟减税规模，和/或增加支出削减。这对短期增长不利，但对美国长期财政健康有益。债券市场的动荡将增加这种结果的可能性。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美银表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">但从我们的观点看，更可能的情况是我们仍将获得一个扩张性的税收方案。长期美债收益率应该会继续反映对财政前景的担忧。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">但除非出现突然变动，否则风险在于：当华盛顿认真对待美国财政问题时，关税可能是唯一能有效减少赤字的手段。另一轮大规模关税上调可能比不那么扩张的财政方案对经济造成更大伤害。</p>

Title:  医药股全线爆发！辉瑞60亿美元押注中国抗癌药 
Description:  <p>辉瑞斥资60亿美元押注中国抗癌药研发，带动中国医药股持续飙升。</p>
<p>20日周二，生物医药股爆发，港股恒生生物科技指数大涨超4%，板块内三生制药（3SBio）涨超35%，荣昌生物涨14%，瀚森制药、石药集团等纷纷走高。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/21f21486-24fb-4bdd-980b-882c68ba6a24.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="419" data-wscnw="867"/></p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及，</a><strong>辉瑞与中国沈阳的三生制药达成协议，就PD-1/VEGF双特异性抗体SSGJ-707达成首付12.5亿美元，总额60.5亿美元的全球开发与商业化协议（除中国内地外），并对三生制药进行1亿美元股权投资和中国商业化选择权。</strong></p>
<p>这一交易在中国药企许可交易中创下新纪录，同时三生制药未来最多可获得4.8亿美元的里程碑式后续费用。<strong>也预示着全球PD-1/VEGF双抗这一炙手可热的赛道竞争将进一步升级，更多中国优质产品将迎来BD可能。</strong></p>
<p>伯恩斯坦的医药和生物技术高级分析师Rebecca Liang表示，辉瑞与三生制药的合作是迄今为止中国生物科技公司最大的一笔对外授权交易。她认为，市场反应表明投资者将此视为对整个行业创新质量日益提升的认可。</p>
<h2>辉瑞押注中国，药物创新成市场新亮点</h2>
<p><strong>值得注意的是，辉瑞还将向三生制药进行1亿美元的股权投资。</strong>三生制药在中国销售一系列用于癌症、自身免疫性疾病、肾脏疾病、皮肤病等疾病的药物。</p>
<p>SSGJ-707是三生制药旗下三生国健基于其专有CLF2平台自主研发的创新双抗药物 。从临床数据看，SSGJ-707潜力不俗。根据三生制药公告，SSGJ-707已在中国开展多项临床研究 。</p>
<p>在针对PD-L1阳性、局部晚期或转移性非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的一线治疗方面，该药物的III期临床研究已获国家药监局药品审评中心（CDE）批准启动，并获得了突破性疗法认定 。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/8b80d687-9a1b-4083-9a37-72e3340a2ebf.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="459" data-wscnw="867"/></p>
<p>这次辉瑞的入场，不仅仅是一次资金投入，更是全球资本对中国创新药的高度认可。过去一年，许多辉瑞的同行都押注中国本土研发的药物来补充其产品线。</p>
<p>据GlobalData统计，<strong>2024年中国药企的授权交易规模创历史新高，占到全球创新药授权的28%。</strong>今年，诺和诺德和默沙东也分别投资了2亿美元，用于引进癌症和心血管药物。</p>
<h2>3SBio药物对标Keytruda，竞争格局引人注目</h2>
<p>辉瑞此次合作<strong>，也可以视为在“抗癌药战局”中的一场关键布局，有望与默克（Merck）Keytruda（全球最畅销药物）抗衡。</strong>三生制药的药物靶点与 Akeso Inc.一款表现优异的药物类似，后者在一次试验中的表现优于Keytruda。值得注意的是，Merck也从中国生物科技公司LaNova Medicines收购了一种类似的药物。</p>
<p>此前，辉瑞曾与Akeso的美国合作伙伴Summit Therapeutics合作，测试Akeso和Summit的药物与辉瑞自身疗法的组合。Daiwa Capital Markets的分析师Wilfred Yuen表示，这项研究协议不会受到新交易的影响。</p>
<p>随着辉瑞、诺和诺德、默沙东等巨头加大投入，中国药企的“出海”步伐逐步加快。Citigroup分析师将3SBio目标价从13港元提升至21港元，预示着市场对中国创新药的信心。</p>
<h2>三生制药计划年内启动后期研究，辉瑞将在美国生产药物</h2>
<p>三生制药计划今年在中国启动该药物的首次后期研究。虽然辉瑞没有概述其自身的临床计划，但该公司在一份声明中表示，它将在美国生产该药物。</p>
<p>花旗分析师在一份报告中写道，这笔新交易应该可以缓解投资者对可能影响授权趋势的地缘政治风险的担忧，而这一趋势已经提振了中国生物科技公司的发展。</p>
<p>花旗分析师写道：“全球扩张是创新制药/生物科技公司的关键投资主题。”花旗在达成协议后，<strong>将三生制药的目标价从13.00港元上调至21.00港元（2.7美元）。</strong></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title: Biden's deterioration unnerved House Democrats as early as 2023, new book reveals

"This was how his father, Bill, had been before he died," the authors write.</li><li>"Biden, Quigley thought, needed to go to bed for the rest of the day and night.

Title: Trump and Hegseth unveil $175 billion plans for Golden Dome missile shield
Description: <p>President <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> on Tuesday touted $25 billion in initial funding for the "<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/19/trump-iron-dome-technology-costs" target="_blank">Golden Dome</a>" and put Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein in charge of realizing the hemispheric missile shield.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Golden Dome — previously dubbed Iron Dome, but separate from Israel's missile defense program — is a mammoth undertaking with enthusiastic backing from the president but many doubters in the national security community.</p><hr><ul><li>Trump said the project will cost around $175 billion and be built over the next three years, though those are both just estimates. The initial $25 billion will be included in the "<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/trump-mike-johnson-freedom-caucus-tax-bill" target="_blank">big beautiful bill</a>" working its way through Congress, Trump said.</li><li>Planning, building, operating and maintaining the Golden Dome, as well as paying for it, will require intense coordination between <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/26/pentagon-hegseth-doge-musk-layoffs" target="_blank">the Pentagon</a>, Congress, current and future presidents, defense contractors and troops. Trump said Canada also expressed interest in being covered by the shield but would have to "pay their fair share."</li><li>Analysts have expressed doubts about the plausibility — and immense costs — of replicating Israel's air defense capabilities at a continental scale. Trump, however, remains bullish.</li></ul><p><strong>The latest: </strong>Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discussed the envisioned countermeasures during a televised Oval Office meeting.</p><ul><li>They said the missile shield will be designed to block hypersonic missiles, ICBMs and other projectiles, including nuclear weapons, whether they are launched from the earth's surface or from space.</li><li>Trump said President Reagan had wanted to build something similar during the Cold War "but they didn't have the technology." Now, he said, the U.S. has "super technology."</li><li>"This is very important for the success and even survival of our country. It's a pretty evil world out there," Trump said.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works: </strong>At the heart of Golden Dome is a mesh of sensors and spotters and space-based interceptors.</p><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Defense companies have been jockeying for position since Trump signed an executive order in January to pursue it.</p><ul><li>Lockheed Martin pitched its <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/f35-f55-trump-qatar-lockheed" target="_blank">F-35 stealth fighter</a>, Sentinel A4 radars, command-and-control networks and more as components.

Title: Trump frustrated by Gaza war, wants Netanyahu to "wrap it up": White House officials
Description: <p>President <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> has been frustrated by the ongoing <a href="https://www.axios.com/world/israel" target="_blank">war in Gaza</a> and upset by images of suffering of Palestinian children, and has told his aides to tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he wants him to wrap it up, two White House officials tell Axios.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>U.S. and Israeli officials deny that Trump is prepared to "abandon" Israel, or that he is applying intense pressure on Netanyahu. But they admit there are growing policy differences between a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/18/gaza-ceasefire-hamas-trump" target="_blank">president who wants to end the war</a> and a prime minister who is massively expanding it.</p><hr><ul><li>"The president is frustrated about what is happening in Gaza. He wants the war to end, he wants the hostages to come home, he wants aid to go in and he wants to start rebuilding Gaza," one White House official said.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> In the days since Trump's trip to the region, the U.S. has been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/18/gaza-ceasefire-hamas-trump" target="_blank">pressing</a> both Israel and Hamas to accept a new proposal presented by White House envoy Steve Witkoff for a hostage and ceasefire deal. </p><ul><li>Witkoff has been speaking directly with Netanyahu and his top adviser Ron Dermer, and to Hamas leadership through a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/edan-alexander-release-secret-talks-bahbah" target="_self">backchannel</a> facilitated by Palestinian-American businessman Bishara Bahbah.</li><li>The negotiations have shown little progress. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces are proceeding with an operation to displace all 2 million Palestinians in Gaza to a "humanitarian zone" and flatten most of the enclave.</li><li>The logjam in the talks and the situation on the ground convinced Vice President Vance to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/vance-skip-israel-visit-gaza-operation" target="_blank">scrap plans</a> for a visit to Israel this week. His decision sheds light on how the U.S. feels about the current Israeli policy in Gaza.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side: </strong>An Israeli official told Axios that at the moment, Netanyahu doesn't feel strong pressure from Trump. "If the president wants a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza he needs to put much more pressure on both sides," the official said.  </p><ul><li>Other leaders are attempting to apply pressure. The leaders of the U.K., France and Canada <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-kingdom-france-and-canada-on-the-situation-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> on Monday threatening to take steps against Israel over the war in Gaza.</li><li>"We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response" they said.</li><li>Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1924569469281550689" target="_blank">rejected</a> their call and accused "the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris" of "offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities."</li></ul><p><strong>The latest:</strong> The British government announced on Monday that it is suspending free trade deal negotiations with Israel, imposed new sanctions on Israeli settlers involved in attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Foreign Office in London.</p><p><strong>State of play:</strong> One area where Trump has put pressure on Netanyahu over the last two weeks is Israel's total freeze on humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. </p><ul><li>A White House official told Axios the president was upset by pictures of suffering children and babies in Gaza and pressed the Israelis to reopen the gates. </li><li>On Sunday, the Israeli cabinet <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/18/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israel" target="_blank">approved</a> the resumption of aid deliveries to Gaza and on Monday a dozen trucks with baby food and other supplies entered the enclave. The White House official said more needs to be done.    </li><li>The UN has warned that thousands of children are at risk of starvation if aid does not significantly increase. More than 55,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> While Trump felt his Middle East trip was a success, he believes the war in Gaza is holding back his plans for the region, a senior White House official said.</p><ul><li>"The President sees a real chance for peace and prosperity in the region, but the war in Gaza is the last hot spot and he wants it to end," the White House official said. </li><li>The second White House official described the war as a distraction from other things Trump wants to do. "There is a lot of frustration by this crisis getting dragged on."</li><li>The official said Trump's decision to move unilaterally to secure the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, rather than waiting for Israel to agree to a broader dael, was a result of this frustration.   </li></ul><p><strong>What they are saying:</strong> "The President may be saying, 'Hey, listen, let's try to end the war,' he might speak strongly… But his support is ironclad," Trump hostage response envoy Adan Boehler <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-hostage-envoy-dismisses-report-israel-abandonment-threat-fake-news" target="_blank">told Fox News</a> on Monday. He stressed that a Washington Post report claiming the administration threatened to "abandon" Israel was "fake."</p><ul><li>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that Trump had "made it very clear to Hamas that he wanted to see all hostages released" and "made it very clear he wants to see this conflict in the region end."</li></ul><p> </p>

Title: The lose-lose calculus of the White House trade war
Description: <p>Usually, there's at least one big group that stands to benefit from White House economic policy: businesses, workers or consumers.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> In this moment, it's not exactly clear who wins from the current administration's triple play of raising tariffs, cutting workplace regulations, and cracking down on immigration.</p><hr><p><strong>State of play: </strong>President Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/17/trump-walmart-tariffs" target="_blank">lashed out</a> at Walmart last weekend, after the company said it would be forced to raise prices to handle higher tariff costs.</p><ul><li>The retailer is the latest company to run into the buzzsaw of the White House trade agenda.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>The White House says its agenda spurs investments that benefit consumers and workers, but shifting trade policy, combined with other fast-paced changes, is creating uncertainty that's roiling almost all corners of <a href="https://www.axios.com/economy" target="_blank">the economy</a>.</p><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> "We've been rocked very hard by the tariffs," says Jonathan Silva, co-owner of WS Game Company, an upscale board-game business that his father started 25 years ago.</p><ul><li>Since "Liberation Day" in April, Silva's raised prices for games, halted all shipments from China, taken a pay cut, and paused retirement benefit contributions for the Massachusetts-based company's 22 employees.</li><li>Now that the most onerous China tariffs have been lifted, the race is on to ship inventory in the next 90 days before the holiday season. He's worried about shipping companies jacking up costs as demand spikes.</li><li>"No matter what happens, the writing's on the wall that with an executive order, things can change on, you know, on just a random Monday."</li></ul><p><strong>Workers, meanwhile, </strong>haven't caught much of a break either. Small business employees, such as those working for Silva, are in a bad spot. Many more are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/07/labor-market-recession-glassdoor" target="_blank">concerned</a> about holding on to their jobs.</p><ul><li>It's not just them. Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, with many more on deck. Those in unions are fighting to keep their right to collective bargaining.</li><li>The harsher situation for public workers is also trickling down to the private sector, where management is newly emboldened to crack the whip, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/07/trump-musk-management-labor-rights" target="_blank">Axios</a> and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/corporate-bosses-workers-culture-changing-cbd19c2c" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> have reported.</li><li>Other changes have hurt, too, like weakening agencies critical to worker protections and reducing the minimum wage for federal contractors.</li></ul><p> <strong>As for consumers? </strong>Tariffs typically mean higher prices. The duties raise input costs for companies, making it more expensive to produce and sell goods, which means higher prices for working people.</p><ul><li>Nobody seems to benefit, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers tells Axios, who says the likelihood is that the tariffs "are going to create<em> </em>fewer good-paying jobs."</li></ul><h2>Looking for winners</h2><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>For all the dire recession warnings, the overall hard data show the economy in good shape.</p><ul><li>The unemployment rate is still low, and inflation is easing.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>The White House seeks to position itself as both pro-business and pro-worker.</p><ul><li>The coming "big beautiful" tax bill is getting positioned as a big win for businesses and working people, who may wind up with some nice new  breaks, including no taxes on tips and a higher standard deduction.</li><li>And those easier regulations are often a win for businesses. The share of executives who say they're concerned about labor regulations fell to 56% this year, down from 73%, per a recent survey from Littler Mendelson, the employment law firm.</li><li>In a recent press release, the White House pointed to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trumps-tariffs-are-lifting-some-u-s-manufacturers-06b4c6e1" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> story that reports some small and midsize U.S. manufacturers are actually seeing increased<em> </em>business due to tariffs.</li></ul><p><strong>For the record: </strong>"The Trump administration is slashing costly regulations, lowering energy prices, cutting Joe Biden's runaway spending that sparked inflation, negotiating better trade deals, and spurring trillions in historic investment commitments, including in sectors critical to our national and economic security," White House spokesman Kush Desai says.</p><ul><li>"Any 'economist' who can't understand how this agenda is benefitting American workers and industries, as the data proves is already happening, should find a new profession."</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Critics argue the small pockets of victory don't seem to outweigh the downsides.</p><ul><li>Some pockets of businesses want certain tariffs in place, acknowledges Heidi Shierholz, the president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute.</li><li>But there isn't a big constituency out there who wanted them to this scale. </li></ul>

That covers lost productivity, health insurance costs, property lost to crime and other variables. </p><ul><li>The cost per case totaled more than $1 million in West Virginia, Rhode Island, Ohio and Maryland.  </li><li>Some of the regional variation in costs is from lost tax revenue, which varies by state. The local availability of treatment for opioid use disorder may also drive the cost, Scott said. </li></ul><p><strong>State of play: </strong>Opioid use disorder — defined as frequent opioid use and unsuccessful efforts to quit — is estimated to affect <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt42731/2022-nsduh-nnr.pdf" target="_blank">more than 6 million people</a> in the United States. </p><ul><li>The cumulative economic burden on patients, including years of life lost and reduced quality of life, exceeded $3 trillion in 2024, Avalere estimated.  </li><li>Private businesses absorbed more than $467 billion in costs from lost productivity and health insurance costs while the federal government bore about $118 billion in Medicare and other federal insurance costs, lost taxes and criminal justice expenses. </li><li>It cost state and local governments more than $94 billion, with about $42 billion of that going toward criminal justice costs. </li><li>The Trump administration in March released its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/the-staggering-cost-of-the-illicit-opioid-epidemic-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Our%20cost%20estimates%20are%20based,2024%20dollars%2C%20is%20as%20follows:" target="_blank">own analysis</a> that estimated illicit opioids cost the U.S. about $2.7 trillion in 2023.</li></ul><p><strong>Where it stands:</strong> Treatment can defray the costs by more than 40% in some instances, the analysis found. </p><ul><li>Behavioral therapy alongside long-acting injectable buprenorphine —<strong> </strong>a treatment that reduces the risk of future overdoses — generated an estimated $295,000 savings per case, the biggest cost-saver of the options Avalere analyzed. </li><li>Therapy plus methadone and therapy plus buprenorphine administered through mucous membranes like the mouth each save about $271,000. Behavioral therapy alone saves a project $144,000 per case.</li><li>The treatment savings estimates assume that patients fully adhere to the regimen for a year.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>Federal data from 2022 showed that only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7325a1.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%203.7%25%20of%20U.S.,medications%20for%20OUD%20(30.0%25)." target="_blank">one-quarter</a> of adults who needed medication treatment for OUD actually got it. </p><ul><li>Less than half of adults who received any OUD care that year got medication treatment. </li><li>However, buprenorphine distribution <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/addressing-the-opioid-crisis-a-look-at-the-evolving-landscape-of-federal-oud-treatment-policies/" target="_blank">increased significantly</a> between 2019 and 2022 as policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed people to start treatment via telehealth. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Overdose deaths in the U.S. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/opioid-overdose-deaths-fall-trump-budget-cuts-2026" target="_blank">fell to the lowest level</a> since 2019 last year, partly due to expanded availability of the overdose reversal drug naloxone.

Title: Trump's deference to Putin stunned European leaders on call
Description: <p>Ukrainian President Zelensky and five other European leaders joined a conference call with President <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> immediately after his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/trump-putin-call-ceasefire-agreement" target="_blank">call with Vladimir Putin </a>on Monday hoping to hear that Putin had agreed to a ceasefire — or the U.S. would impose penalties on him for refusing to do so.</p><ul><li>Instead, Trump said Putin had agreed to negotiate, stressed the U.S. wouldn't be involved in those negotiations, and pushed back against the idea of imposing sanctions on Putin at the current time, two sources who were on the call and a third source briefed on the call told Axios.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Trump gave the impression he was getting closer to withdrawing from the issue altogether.<strong> </strong>Some leaders on the call seemed "surprised" or "shocked," the sources said.</p><hr><ul><li>"I think something's going to happen. And if it doesn't, I just back away and they're going to have to keep going. Again, this was a European situation, and should have remained a European situation," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office several hours after his calls. </li></ul><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> Trump and Zelensky had a brief call Monday morning, and Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart what he should tell Putin, the sources said. </p><ul><li>Zelensky was happy Trump called him to consult. He requested that Trump demand an immediate ceasefire, threaten new sanctions against Russia, and offer no concessions to Putin without consulting Ukraine, the sources say.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes: </strong>When the call with Putin ended, Trump called Zelensky again. This time the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland and the European Commission were also on the line. </p><ul><li>"The second call was longer and of a different character than the first one," Zelensky said later.</li><li>While a European source on the call told Axios it was "constructive," another source said Zelensky felt it was "bad."</li></ul><p><strong>Trump told the leaders</strong> that Putin agreed to start direct negotiations on a ceasefire immediately. A source on the call said there were a few seconds of puzzled silence.</p><ul><li>Zelensky then pointed out that Putin had previously agreed to negotiate, and the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/16/russia-ukraine-ceasefire-talks-turkey" target="_blank">first round of ceasefire talks took place</a> on Friday in Istanbul. Trump didn't directly respond, the sources said. </li><li>The sources said Zelensky and several other leaders on the call told Trump it had been his idea to start the peace talks with an immediate 30-day ceasefire. </li><li>A White House official told Axios Trump "never agreed" that a ceasefire should be a prerequisite for negotiations and never said Zelensky can decide what the conditions for negotiations will be.   </li></ul><p><strong>Friction point: </strong>Other European leaders on the call asked about the possibility of U.S. sanctions against Russia, but Trump said he didn't think was a good idea and stressed that he thought Putin wanted a deal. </p><ul><li>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni jumped in to ask why there couldn't be a ceasefire for at least two weeks heading into the talks, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked what concessions Russia was willing to make, the sources said. </li><li>Trump told the group Putin would present a "peace memo" with his terms for a ceasefire and for ending the war. A source on the call said Trump told Zelensky and the European leaders he asked Putin to present "something people can agree to" and not a proposal that will be rejected immediately.</li><li>Zelensky said previous rounds of negotiations with Putin, including last week, didn't produce anything and stressed that if Trump doesn't push, Putin won't move, the sources said.</li><li>The White House official said that for months Russia had refused to present a document with its vision of how to end the war and the fact Putin agreed to do it was a significant step forward.  </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> Leaders on the call seemed surprised that Trump seemed relatively content with what he heard from Putin, and presented it as a new development, even though the Russian leader did not seem to have changed his position at all, the sources said.</p><p><strong>What to watch:</strong> Trump told the group that Russia and Ukraine should conduct bilateral direct negotiations without any third party mediators because the parties best understand all the details of the conflict. </p><ul><li>Meloni and Merz said the U.S. and European countries need to be involved in the negotiations. "Someone needs to be a judge," Meloni said. Merz proposed holding a meeting with all the parties present.  </li><li>Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/pope-leo-host-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-trump" target="_blank">later suggested the Vatican</a> as a venue for the talks.</li></ul><p><strong>Where it stands:</strong> On the call, Finland President Alexander Stubb asked Trump what the next steps were. "I don't know. Someone has to come out and say whether the negotiations are going well or badly, and then we'll decide what to do," Trump said. </p><p><em>This story was updated with comments from a White House official. </em></p>

Title: Biden's cancer diagnosis draws sympathy — and suspicion
Description: <p>Former <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/joe-biden" target="_blank">President Biden</a>'s disclosure that he had Stage 4 <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/biden-prostate-cancer-diagnosis" target="_blank">prostate cancer</a> was quickly met with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/18/biden-cancer-prostate-tributes-congress-leaders-react" target="_blank">sympathy</a> late Sunday. By Monday morning, the questions — from Democrats and Republicans alike — had begun.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The timing of Biden's announcement, coupled with the way his handlers tried to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/book-biden-cabinet-crisis-access" target="_blank">cover up his health issues</a> in the past, fueled speculation about how long he'd known about the cancer.</p><hr><p>People in both parties, whether they love Joe Biden or despise him, wondered whether the announcement was timed to change the subject after a week of reports about his physical and mental deterioration when he was president.</p><ul><li>Those reports included <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/16/biden-hur-tape-special-counsel-audio" target="_blank">recordings</a>, first posted Friday by Axios, of Biden being interviewed by prosecutors in 2023 about his handling of classified documents. Biden had such difficulty recalling events that prosecutor Robert Hur later described him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> On Monday, medical experts didn't exactly calm the suspicions about Biden's cancer diagnosis — even as they said it was treatable and that he could live several years with the disease.</p><ul><li>"He's had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading," Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who was a Biden White House COVID adviser, told the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/morning-joe-stunned-oncologist-says-131633655.html" target="_blank">stunned hosts</a> of MSNBC's "Morning Joe."</li><li>Emanuel later told CNN that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test used to detect prostate cancer isn't always reliable. Emanuel and other doctors noted that Biden, 82, is well beyond the 55-70 recommended age range for prostate cancer screening.</li><li>But given how thoroughly presidents' health is scrutinized, it would be surprising if Biden hadn't been tested before his recent symptoms appeared, Emanuel said on "Morning Joe": "It's a little strange."</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out:</strong> Several former Biden White House aides acknowledged they were perplexed.</p><ul><li>"I love Joe Biden," a former campaign and White House aide told Axios. "But I don't feel the same about some of the people around him. So I feel terrible saying this: I just don't know what to believe."</li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Trump</a></strong><a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank"></a> and the White House initially offered sympathy for Biden and did not engage in speculation on Sunday.</p><ul><li>But on Monday, Trump told reporters: "I'm surprised the public wasn't notified a long time ago ... I think if you take a look, it's the same doctor who said Joe was cognitively fine."</li></ul><p><strong>Some of Trump's MAGA loyalists</strong> struck a similar chord on social media, sending a mix of prayers and I-told-you-so messages about Biden's health — an issue they'd been harping on for years.</p><ul><li>Vice President Vance <a href="https://x.com/ericldaugh/status/1924472174225633681?s=46" target="_blank">questioned</a> the care Biden received and whether his advisers were honest, telling reporters: "We can pray for good health — but also recognize that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job."</li><li>Donald Trump Jr. asked on <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1924250965965709808" target="_blank">X</a> whether former First Lady Jill Biden was part of "another coverup."</li></ul><p><strong>Flashback: </strong>The Bidens have been silent about cancer in the family before, according to "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sin-President-Cover-Up-Disastrous-ebook/dp/B0DXCMSHVL" target="_blank">Original Sin</a>," a book by Axios' Alex Thompson and CNN's Jake Tapper that's being released today.</p><ul><li>When the Bidens' son Beau was attorney general of Delaware in 2013, he had brain surgery to remove a tumor and was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma — one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer.</li><li>Beau and then-Vice President Biden's teams deliberated whether to explain his situation publicly, but decided to say nothing for months, according to "Original Sin."</li></ul><p><strong>In February 2014</strong>, Dr. Wai-Kwan Alfred Yung released a statement that Beau had a "clean bill of health."</p><ul><li>Beau Biden died 15 months later, soon after he left office.</li><li>The book says that for the last year of his life, as he had difficulties with speech and other everyday tasks, Beau Biden was quietly flown around the country for experimental treatments and usually admitted into hospitals under an alias: George Lincoln.</li></ul><p><strong>Even some members </strong>of the Biden family didn't understand the lack of transparency.</p><ul><li>According to "Original Sin," Beau's wife, Hallie, expressed frustration about concealing the disease rather than telling people. The public would rally around Beau, she argued to friends. But Joe and Beau Biden opposed going public.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> A Biden spokesperson declined to comment on Monday. </p><ul><li>But on Tuesday the former president's team shed some light on Biden's diagnosis, saying that his "last known PSA [test] was in 2014," meaning he stopped getting tested when he was 70 or 71, about the age at which the test no longer is recommended.</li><li>The spokesperson added: "Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer."</li></ul><p><em>This story has been updated to reflect the Biden spokesperson's comment on Tuesday. </em></p>

Title: Gen Z's new side hustle: selling data
Description: <p>Many young people are more willing than their parents to share personal data, giving companies deeper insight into their lives.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Selling data is becoming the new selling plasma.</p><hr><p><strong>Case in point: </strong>Generation Lab, a youth polling company, is launching a new product, <a href="https://verbai.generationlab.org/" target="_blank">Verb.AI</a>, today — betting that buying this data is the future of polling.</p><ul><li>"We think corporations have extracted user data without fairly compensating people for their own data," says Cyrus Beschloss, CEO of Generation Lab. "We think users should know exactly what data they're giving us and should feel good about what they're receiving in return."</li></ul><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Generation Lab offers people cash — $50 or more per month, depending on use and other factors — to download a tracker onto their phones.</p><ul><li>The product takes about 90 seconds to download, and once it’s on your phone, it tracks things like what you browse, what you buy, which streaming apps you use — all anonymously.

Title: AI agents will do programmers' grunt work
Description: <p>AI makers are flooding the market with a new wave of coding <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/26/generative-ai-next-act-autonomous-agents" target="_blank">agents</a> promising to relieve human programmers of busy work.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Automating the routine aspects of technical labor will almost certainly transform and downsize the tech industry workforce — but there's no guarantee it will alleviate software development's biggest headaches.</p><hr><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> Microsoft Monday <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/" target="_blank">announced</a> a new AI coding agent for Github Copilot that's good for "time-consuming but boring tasks."</p><ul><li>"The agent excels at low-to-medium complexity tasks in well-tested codebases, from adding features and fixing bugs to extending tests, refactoring code, and improving documentation," Microsoft's post says.</li><li>Github's move follows Friday's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/" target="_blank">announcement</a> by OpenAI of Codex, a "research preview" of a new coding agent that can "work on many tasks in parallel."</li><li>Notably, the Github Copilot agent is powered not by Codex or any other tool from Microsoft partner OpenAI, but instead by Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet, per Microsoft.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue:</strong> Tech leaders have sent mixed messages on just how much work they see ahead for programmers. </p><ul><li>Amazon Web Services' then-boss Matt Garman caused a stir last year when he suggested the need for human coding <a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/08/23/1736253/aws-ceo-says-most-developers-could-stop-coding-soon-as-ai-takes-over" target="_blank">could disappear within two years</a>, However, he later told Axios that his comments were taken out of context.</li><li>"I think it's incredibly exciting time for developers," he told us last year. "There's a whole bunch of work that developers do today that's not fun."</li><li>"If you think about documenting your code, if you think about upgrading Java versions, if you think about looking for bugs,  that's that's not what developers love doing. They love thinking about, 'How do I go solve problems?' "</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Business transformations that start in Silicon Valley usually make their way into the wider economy.</p><ul><li>Silicon Valley's "dogfooding" tradition ensures that it will avidly apply new technologies to its own business first.</li><li>Both Microsoft and Google are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/microsoft-ceo-says-up-to-30-of-the-companys-code-was-written-by-ai/" target="_blank">claiming</a> that roughly 30% of the code they produce is AI-written.</li></ul><p><strong>Coding agents,</strong> like other generative AI tools, continue to "hallucinate," or make stuff up.</p><ul><li>But programs, unlike other kinds of language products, have a built-in pass-fail test: Either they run or they don't.</li><li>That gives programmers one early checkpoint to guard against bad code.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> AI-generated code likely also contains tons of other errors that don't show up today. </p><ul><li>That will cause nightmares in the future as programs age, get used more widely, or face unexpected tests from unpredictable users.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>The software industry's assumption that what works inside tech will work everywhere else could be sorely tested when these techniques get pushed out beyond Silicon Valley. </p><ul><li>AI's usefulness in writing code may not easily transfer to other kinds of work that are less abstract and more rooted in physical reality — witness the many setbacks and challenges the autonomous vehicle industry has faced. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> Nobody doubts that AI means tech firms will write more code using fewer employees. But no one yet knows exactly where these companies will continue to find competitive advantage.</p><ul><li>AI models are much more likely to be interchangeable than human organizations and cultures.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next:  </strong>As coding agents shoulder routine labor, product designers and creative engineers will use "vibe coding" — improvisational rough drafting via "throw it at the wall and see what works" AI prompting — to do fast prototyping of new ideas.</p><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The biggest challenges in creating software tend to arise from poorly conceived specifications and misinterpretations of data, both of which are often rooted in confusion over human needs.</p><ul><li>Today's large language models are ill-equipped to tackle those problems. </li><li>But software developers who excel at navigating the boundaries between human desire and machine capability should continue to find themselves in demand.</li></ul>

Title: MAGA faithful grow frustrated with Trump's Justice Department
Description: <p>The <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">MAGA masses</a> are growing disillusioned with Justice Department officials who are failing to deliver damning information on a laundry list of hot-button issues — especially Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The movement's back-against-the-wall mentality is kicking up fresh suspicions that nefarious government actors are out to stall <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/trump-retaliation-revenge-biden-security-clearance" target="_blank">President Trump's agenda</a>.</p><hr><ul><li>Drumbeat calls for repercussions in the Epstein case — among others — are not going anywhere, and the administration will likely have to answer to the base until some handcuffs click.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>Kash Patel and Dan Bongino — the FBI's No. 1 and No. 2 officials — insisted in a Fox News interview Sunday that Epstein killed himself. Those comments contradicted a popular conspiracy theory that he was killed to protect high-profile clients of his sex trafficking network.</p><ul><li>MAGA podcasters were delighted and later outraged when they were invited to the White House earlier this year to get supposedly new documents on Epstein's death from Attorney General Pam Bondi, only to learn that little new information was included in their beefy binders.</li><li>Prominent voices in the movement like Laura Loomer have also demanded arrests of Biden administration officials who, in their telling, weaponized the justice system against then-candidate Trump.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side:</strong> The administration has offered some overtures to the base, including Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/%40realDonaldTrump/posts/114534665591178846" target="_blank">posting </a>Monday that Democrats "HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO" for celebrity endorsements last year that he claims were paid for and amount to "AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM."</p><ul><li>But it's not enough for MAGA.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>After Bongino <a href="https://x.com/FBIDDBongino/status/1924115672021241991" target="_blank">reiterated</a> that Epstein killed himself, he was flooded with responses of disbelief.</p><ul><li>"WHO has bought the both of you?" one X user <a href="https://x.com/ShakesandBerry/status/1924150200177684816" target="_blank">asked</a> of Bongino and Patel, referencing the Fox News interview.</li><li>"We are months into the Trump administration, past the 100-day mark, and Pam Blondi has failed to bring any real charges against anyone," Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with ties to Trump, added on "War Room" Monday, using a nickname for Bondi.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>MAGA followers are feeling emboldened after extensive reporting about former President Biden's mental acuity and newly revealed cancer diagnosis, viewing the developments as confirmation of their suspicions and rebuttal to claims they're merely conspiracy theorists.</p><p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Not everyone is ready to flip the table. While some people like Bondi are still building up their MAGA bona fides, others like Patel and Bongino have longstanding credibility with conspiracy-minded Trump fans — in part by echoing claims about Epstein.</p><ul><li>"The MAGA base's frustration is understandable, but if they think people like Bongino or Patel have 'gone native' then they've gone nuts. Pam Bondi's early Epstein flub was a symptom of trying to do too much at once, and toss some meat to the base to keep them sated. That was silly," The National Pulse's Raheem Kassam texted Axios.</li><li>"But the underlying point remains, Kash and Dan are bad-asses at the height of their efficacy. They deserve more time and more trust."</li></ul>

Title:  大摩中期策略：下半年美元继续跌，但超配美国股债，择时是关键 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">尽管经济增长放缓，且政策不确定性较高，但是摩根士丹利看好美国股债，并预期美元将走弱。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月21日，据追风交易台消息，摩根士丹利在最新中期策略展望报告中称，预计下半年美元将继续贬值，但美国股债等资产仍然将是全球资金“避无可避”的选择。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告指出，尽管面临经济增长放缓，叠加前所未有的政策不确定性，但预计至2026年中，美国资产整体表现将优于全球其他市场，理由是关税威胁缓和，降低经济衰退可能性，同时伴随着实质性的货币宽松和监管放松。摩根士丹利称：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">对美国股票持超配立场，预期到明年二季度标普500指数将达到6500点，较当前水平上涨约9%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9f684d2a-58b8-425f-9b2f-f4a0b84f05ae.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="352" data-wscnw="1053"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">预计10年期美国国债收益率将降至3.45%，将为固定收益投资者创造约13%的总回报。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美元指数是大摩唯一预计表现较弱的美国资产，预计美元指数到2026年中将贬值9%至91，欧元兑美元汇率升至1.25，日元兑美元走强至130。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/da3e4d2b-ee73-4849-bdb7-ffb3a4f11e05.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="419" data-wscnw="578"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩还在报告中强调，在政策不确定性加剧的环境中，把握投资时机至关重要。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美元贬值在所难免，对冲至关重要</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根士丹利认为，美元强势时代或已终结，背后有两大核心驱动力正在消失：<strong>美国相对其他G10经济体的增长优势和收益率优势将大幅减弱</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告特别指出，更令投资者忧心的是，美国货币政策独立性的疑虑一旦出现，很难被消除。</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">这可能导致外国投资者减少对美资产的配置，转向非美资产，尤其在分配新资金时，同时外国投资者增加对美国资产敞口的货币对冲比例，两者都将给美元带来持续压力。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">这也是大摩预计欧元、日元、瑞郎等避险货币将受益的一个原因。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大摩表示，货币对冲将对预期回报和回报分布的波动性产生重要影响，对于以欧元为基础货币的投资者而言，标普500指数的预期回报从未对冲时的0%变为对冲时的7%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/17f25b26-df5c-4d6f-a9e8-d514d2a4cfe6.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="311" data-wscnw="1171"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美国股债仍是资金“避无可避”的选择</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告称，美元持续走弱无疑会助长&#34;美元资产失去避险吸引力&#34;的叙事，而且在市场上已有异常现象，即4月美国资产遭抛售期间，美元与标普500指数之间的相关性飙升至极端正值。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这不符合避险货币在股市下跌时应当走强的常规表现。同时，今年以来欧洲股市的资金流入明显更强，也表明美股需求似乎正在减弱。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">但大摩认为，对美元资产需求消失的担忧被过度夸大。数据显示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">全球股票基金对美国的配置变化并未超过过去一季度指数权重的变化。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/69ef74ec-294e-453b-915a-e3ca36185f43.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="565" data-wscnw="699"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">外国持有的美元债券数量达到历史最高，表明非美投资者仍在购买美元资产，尤其是高质量美元资产。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/c99519dc-6f89-42ec-bcfd-05d9bdeffa76.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="523" data-wscnw="695"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告称，美元资产的市场体量仍是无可替代的优势。美国约50万亿美元的可投资股票市值几乎是第二大市场欧洲的五倍，超过一半的高质量流动性固定收益资产以美元计价。<strong>即使资金大规模流出美国资产，可替代的投资市场也极为有限</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">不过，大摩同时也指出，这并不意味着未来不会出现美元资产的替代品。只是市场规模的转变需要时间，这意味着<strong>当前&#34;别无选择&#34;(TINA)的市场主题仍将持续</strong>。</p>
<p>对于<strong>股票市场</strong>，大摩的策略师认为，中美贸易紧张局势的缓和降低了经济衰退的可能性，并消除了最极端的下行风险。</p>
<p>这意味着，股市短期内不太可能跌破4月份的低点，尤其是考虑到今年迄今为止的大幅下跌主要是对关税冲击的反应。</p>
<p>大摩的股票策略师预计，未来的美国政策议程将更具宽松性。</p>
<p>对于<strong>国债市场</strong>，大摩认为经济放缓和美联储降息最为重要。美债收益率预测更侧重于低增长和宽松政策。</p>
<p>大摩预计美联储降息的次数将超过市场目前的预期，这将导致国债收益率下降，尤其是在2026年初。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">择时是关键</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">报告称，在2025年的展望中，大摩就提出了&#34;择时至关重要&#34;，认为地缘政治不确定性和高估值意味着投资者应保持灵活应变。在最新的报告中，大摩认为，这一观点仍然适用。下半年关注以下几个政策变化的时机：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>关税政策：</strong>预计市场聚焦的美国重点贸易伙伴的关税水平将持续，会有不断变化的截止日期和潜在临时升级</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>财政政策：</strong>预计第三季度末通过《减税与就业法案》(TCJA)延期</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>金融监管：</strong>巴塞尔协议III终局提案（预计于2025年第四季度）将对证券化产品和金融股产生重大影响。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>货币政策：</strong>美联储料将在2025年剩余时间保持利率不变，直到2026年第一季度才开始降息，全年共降息175个基点，而市场当前仅计价两次降息。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/6e616769-8a80-4dc9-b9ae-2ad878f84fd7.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="571" data-wscnw="714"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根士丹利建议，考虑到政策决定变得与市场一样难以预测，投资者应保持灵活，以把握政策变化带来的投资机会。</p>

Title:  继续“无人问津”，日本国债的雷，依然没有任何缓解 
Description:  <p>在经历周二债市大幅波动后，日本超长期债券周三几乎没有得到任何喘息的机会。</p>
<p>日本债券市场连续第二天无人出价，30年期和 40 年期日本国债收益率均创下历史新高。20年期日本国债收益率一度上涨1.5个基点至2.57%，创下自2000年10月以来的最高水平。这一收益率在周二跃升了令人震惊的15个基点。同时，30年期收益率下跌1.5个基点至3.110%，较其创纪录的3.14%略有回落，而40年期收益率则在触及周二3.6%的历史峰值后保持在3.595%不变。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/d032bc9b-5bd6-4896-bc46-ca355a38340c.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1025" data-wscnw="1741" data-wscnsize="228135"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okasan Securities首席债券策略师Naoya Hasegawa警告：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">要使超长期债券的需求反弹，市场需要获得更大的保证，即将减少新债券的发行，这在本财年内在技术上是可能的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>此前周二，日本财务省周20年期国债拍卖<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747438?keyword=%E6%9A%B4%E9%9B%B7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">录得灾难性结果</a>。投标倍数仅为2.5倍，远低于上月的2.96倍，创下自2012年以来的最低水平。尾差（Auction Tail，即平均价格与最低接受价格之间的差距）从4月份的0.34飙升至1.14，为1987年以来最高水平。<span data-start="420" data-end="446">市场需求极为低迷，买家基本不愿意接盘长期国债</span>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/87931917-d93b-42dd-b9dc-a6a80593a87c.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="656" data-wscnw="1280"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">日本债券市场今年一直承受着巨大压力，3月由海外德国国债滑坡引发的大规模抛售尤为剧烈。最近，多个政党呼吁减少消费税，这一提议目前被石破茂首相拒绝，但市场担忧最终可能出台财政刺激政策。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">通胀高于目标和财政刺激的可能性为收益率增加了上行压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">日本央行目前正尝试减少债券购买并实现货币政策正常化，但超长期收益率的飙升使这一进程面临严峻挑战。更为严重的是，长期借贷成本的上升对高度负债的日本政府来说是一个危险信号。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">日经资产管理公司首席全球策略师Naomi Fink认为，<strong>目前走势突显了日本政府需要注意其使日本恢复基本收支平衡承诺的必要性。</strong>通胀上升预示着日本央行将减少债券购买，使市场更容易受到对价格更敏感的买家需求的影响。</p>
<p>分析认为，<strong>市场情绪在未来几周内可能继续承压，因为30年期债券下周和40年期债券的拍卖即将来临。随着日本央行逐渐退出市场，债券价格将更多地受到对价格敏感的投资者行为影响。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">对于全球投资者而言，这一发展表明日本的超宽松货币政策时代可能即将结束，这将对全球利率市场产生深远影响。随着全球主要经济体债务水平普遍攀升，日本债市的动荡可能成为其他高负债国家的预警信号。</p>

Title:  德银：大家都知道美债不可持续，但不知道何时会崩溃 
Description:  <p>当美国债务危机真正爆发时，后果将比我们想象的更为严重。</p>
<p>周三，德意志银行主题策略师Jim Reid在其最新的每日图表分析中指出:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>金融市场最广泛认同的事实之一就是美国国债处于不可持续的路径上，最大的未知数是何时会崩溃，关税可能加速了这一危机的到来。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reid认为，无论是通过有意为之还是纯粹偶然，美国的&#34;过度特权&#34;——即以远低于公允价值的成本借款的能力——正在逐渐消退，美元的储备货币地位也在弱化。</p>
<p>根据报告，这种特权使美国的借贷成本降低约70个基点，使其在不增加利息负担的情况下能够承担额外25个百分点的债务与GDP比率，而债务与GDP比率或将在未来十年飙升至200%以上。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9c1f5118-774b-4a16-a65c-c88f6c3403f9.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="496" data-wscnw="1194" data-wscnsize="63688"/></p>
<p>在穆迪下调美国主权评级后的首个交易日，美股不仅没有下跌，反而收高。这与2011年8月标普首次下调美国评级后股市暴跌7%的情况形成鲜明对比。有分析认为，答案简单明了：“投资者已接受美国债务将以荒谬速度扩张的事实...直到灾难真正来临。”</p>
<h2>美国债务末日图：未来恐怖轨迹已定</h2>
<p>虽然穆迪取消美国最后一个AAA评级不应让任何人感到震惊，但这无疑是美国财政大厦上出现的另一道裂缝。穆迪的理由特别直接：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>他们假设2017年减税政策将被延续（与国会预算办公室最近的估计不同），这将推动债务和赤字大幅上升，其关键预测包括：</p>
<ol>
<li>利息支出加上强制性支出将从2024年占联邦支出的73%上升到2035年的78%；</li>
<li>财政赤字将从占GDP的6.4%上升到2035年约9%；</li>
<li>债务与GDP比率将从当前的98%上升到2035年的134%；</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim Reid在他的分析中，将这些预测与美国债务和赤字的历史趋势以及国会预算办公室的半年度预测进行了对比。虽然国会预算办公室的基准预测不包括减税延期，但其替代方案之一（包含减税延期）显示，未来几十年债务与GDP比率将超过200%。对于好奇&#34;灾难将至&#34;在未来会是什么样子的人来说，它将沿着债务末日图表中的淡蓝线某处出现。</p>

Title:  泡泡玛特的无限游戏有危险了 
Description:  <p style="text-align: right;"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/6baa4f4a-0dfb-49fd-8050-b28a547d65ae.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="454" data-wscnw="843" data-wscnsize="540156"/>作者 | 王小娟</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">编辑 | 黄昱</p>
<p>最近，泡泡玛特家的“顶流艺人”LABUBU又升咖了。</p>
<p>在不久前的巴黎时装周上，泰国公主思蕊梵娜瓦瑞被拍到在爱马仕包上挂了LABUBU。这让不少时尚圈的弄潮儿争相效仿，在爱马仕、LV等大牌包上，也挂上LABUBU。</p>
<p>去年以来，在全球不少门店，抢LABUBU的人排出数百米长队。体现在对泡泡玛特业绩的贡献上，2024年，LABUBU所在的THE MONSTERS系列营收高达30.4亿元，同比增长726.6%，占到了泡泡玛特总营收的23.3%。</p>
<p>LABUBU在全球大受欢迎，泡泡玛特也成为二级市场上最被追捧的股票之一。5月20日盘中，其股价一度来到212.2港元/股，再次刷新其最高股价记录，市值也短暂超过了2800亿港元。</p>
<p>但泡泡玛特的生意也是一门无限的游戏，需要持续打造被追捧的爆款IP。不然，当如今的“女明星”过气，用户的新鲜感消失之后，泡泡玛特可能又会像几年前一样陷入低迷。</p>
<p>能不能培养出下一个顶流，是市场当前对泡泡玛特的新期待。</p>
<h2 data-header="4" data-foldable="true" data-default-linespacing="100">爆款养成</h2>
<p>即使不怎么关注潮玩的人，这两年也在社交媒体上刷到过一个有着毛茸茸的身体、尖尖的耳朵、总是露出九颗牙坏笑的淘气精灵搪胶毛绒玩偶。</p>
<p>她就是LABUBU，是中国香港艺术家龙家升创作的“THE MONSTERS”（精灵天团）系列中一个，由泡泡玛特独家签约并进行运营。经过几年的养成，如今已经成长为泡泡玛特旗下当红的“女明星”。</p>
<p>LABUBU和她的伙伴们被泡泡玛特于2018年签约，过去几年也一直不温不火。其去年爆火，离不开名人们的“带货”，也离不开泰国市场的助推。</p>
<p>在过去的一年里，她被泰国出生的女团偶像Lisa疯狂扫货，被泰国公主思蕊梵娜瓦瑞挂在爱马仕上。甚至，泰国官方也在为这一IP的爆火添砖加瓦。去年，身穿泰国服饰的LABUBU人偶到达泰国机场，泰国旅游与体育部部长瑟姆萨·蓬帕尼的亲自前来接机，并为其授予“神奇泰国体验官”的称号。</p>
<p>最近，在社交媒体上，LABUBU则一跃成为爱马仕等一众大牌包的首选挂饰。甚至有网友表示：“因为LABUBU要买人生第一款高奢包了。”这意味着，LABUBU甚至可以反向带货爱马仕了。</p>
<p>这CP看似抽象，但其实两者有很多相似之处。一个是“配货界祖师爷”，一个是“潮玩界SSR”，两者都擅长通过饥饿营销来制造稀缺性。</p>
<p>众所周知，爱马仕有着一套非常严格的配货机制，不同的消费等级，对应着不同级别的包。而想买到泡泡玛特家的当家女明星，也是需要一系列复杂的流程，比如限时抢购、捆绑非热门商品销售等，而如果想要拿到隐藏款，则需要持续不断开盲盒。</p>
<p>如此来看，这俩一个靠配货制度拿捏贵妇，一个靠隐藏款套路“收割”年轻人，都是社交货币极度内卷之下的产物。以前贵妇们拼铂金包的鳄鱼皮纹路，和现在潮人们拼LABUBU的稀有度，本质上是同一个逻辑。</p>
<p>甚至在社交媒体上，有行业人士分析，买爱马仕和买LABUBU的都是同一批人，都愿意为情绪价值买单。</p>
<p>在二手的逻辑上，两者都有很多相似之处。爱马仕在包界一直有着相对不错的保值性，而二手市场上，LABUBU也因为足够稀缺，成为炒娃客的最新理财产品。</p>
<p>如今成为CP之后，爱马仕也焕发出更多年轻活力气质，而泡泡玛特也再次升咖。</p>
<p>LABUBU在东南亚爆火的同时，泡泡玛特也加码在海外点燃这一热情。</p>
<p>而在海外新店的选址上，泡泡玛特选择各大核心地标商圈，和一众奢侈品成为邻居。在法国，其将门店开在巴黎奥斯曼大道，靠近老佛爷百货；在英国，门店位于伦敦牛津街，毗邻John Lewis百货及伦敦艺术大学。</p>
<p>门店本身开在核心商圈，又辅以限量款、联名款等手段，泡泡玛特各地的门店成为了游客与本地潮人的社交打卡中心，天然具备高曝光度和流量转化优势。</p>
<p>前段时间，LABUBU在全球发售第三代搪胶毛绒产品“前方高能”系列，当晚美国门店现场大排长龙，次日，泡泡玛特APP登顶美国App Store购物榜，这也是该官方应用在购物榜的首次登顶，并一跃成为 App Store免费总榜的第四名。</p>
<p>可见，全世界都在为这一只丑萌兔子疯狂，也让其化身为泡泡玛特的印钞机。</p>
<p>根据泡泡玛特2024年的财报，LABUBU带着它的怪物家族狂揽30亿元，相当于每天睁眼就有830万元进账。</p>
<p>整体来看，THE MONSTERS也贡献了泡泡玛特130.38亿元营收的23.3%，而在2023年时，这一系列占营收的比重仅为5.8%，从各系列对业绩的贡献来看，THE MONSTERS是去年泡泡玛特业绩的关键变量。</p>
<h2 data-header="4" data-foldable="true" data-default-linespacing="100">无限游戏</h2>
<p>THE MONSTERS系列的爆火，也让泡泡玛特的股价走出前几年的阴霾期，去年以来持续冲高。到5月20日，泡泡玛特盘中最高股价达到212.2港元/股，市值也一度超过2800亿港元。</p>
<p>在这一轮上涨中，摩根士丹利的分析师指出由于LABUBU V3在全球的需求强劲，尤其是美国市场，将带动新店开业，成为2025至26年的关键增长因素。</p>
<p>但潮玩本身是一个无限的游戏，需要持续创造新品来吸引用户注意力。</p>
<p>LABUBU大火之后，要面对的是同质化的竞争和用户审美的疲劳，泡泡玛特也不是说就能依靠LABUBU而高枕无忧了。</p>
<p>尽管当前LABUBU已经能和爱马仕炒“CP”了，但是其和爱马仕还是有很多不同。爱马仕依旧在奢侈品界拥有统治性的地位，但在潮玩市场，LABUBU的爆火具有一定的偶然性。爱马仕能穿越一个个审美周期，但LABUBU很可能像此前的众多同行一样，有一天也沦为时代的眼泪。</p>
<p>毕竟，公主的爱马仕上，今天可能挂LABUBU，明天就有可能挂Jellycat。在爱马仕上，人们很少去讨论审美疲劳，而在潮玩上面，总是新品更令人期待。可以说，这对CP中，爱马仕的铁打的，而LABUBU们则是流动的。</p>
<p>潮玩本身就有自己的生命周期。比如，曾一年赚数十亿，亚洲吸金天团LINE FRIENDS也在2021年关闭了最后中国内地最后一家线下门店。而从大火时排队需要数小时到关店退场，仅过了5年。</p>
<p>值得一提的时，LINE FRIENDS关店前后的2021年4月，泡泡玛特发售了一款地球女儿400%限量款，引发排队“抢娃”，现场堪比春运。但几年过去，尽管Molly系列依旧贡献着泡泡玛特16%的营收，但一个明显的特点是，当年的Molly还是C位顶流，现在只能给LABUBU当陪衬。</p>
<p>可见，潮玩圈没有永远的神，只有永远的“新神替代旧神”。</p>
<p>而泡泡玛特也一直在抓紧培养一堆“练习生”，以期在LABUBU过气后，能顺利承接。但爆火除了运营之外，还有一定的运气成分，存在巨大的不确定性。当前，泡泡玛特依靠中国强大的供应链，在海外市场驰骋，但从IP来看，能打的IP主要还是LABUBU，IP迭代问题很有可能在未来一段时间困扰到泡泡玛特。</p>
<p>要知道，这样的过往经历并不是没有。在Molly热度褪去，且盲盒生意被更严格的监管约束之后，泡泡玛特在2022年前后经历过一段火热IP青黄不接的时期。那段时间，股价一度跌破10港元/股。这也说明，泡泡玛特股价波动与IP的受欢迎程度有很大的关系。</p>
<p>除了IP的承接这个最大的不确定性之外，疯狂的二手交易也在成为其风险。</p>
<p>当前，LABUBU新品不少在二手市场有着数十倍的溢价。而随着新品的上市，此前的款大打折扣，但黄牛囤货规模一直在膨胀。</p>
<p>二手市场会为爆火按下加速键，也会是爆冷的助推器。如若二手市场持续过热，很可能像此前盲盒过热一样，引发监管的下场；而如果随着市场热度退散，泡沫破裂，黄牛不再炒作，很可能会加速这一IP的衰落，泡泡玛特本身也会受到影响。</p>
<p>就资本市场而言，根据最新的股价，泡泡玛特的市盈率已经超过80倍，处于比较高的水平，当前股价存在一定的泡沫。</p>
<p>此前，已有一些资本开始撤出。蜂巧资本（BORCHID CAPITAL）发文称，由于蜂巧人民币一期基金即将到期，蜂巧资本于近一周内通过大宗交易分三次集中出清了所有在上市前买入的泡泡玛特股份。据港交所信息，蜂巧资本套现金额超过22亿港元。</p>
<p>除了蜂巧资本，2024年以来，包括黑蚁资本、王宁夫妇在内的多位股东已累计减持超20亿港元。一众资本的退出，也意味着泡泡玛特正在向成熟的潮玩IP公司转变，未来也更加考验公司自身的运营能力。</p>
<p>无限游戏在继续，尽管如今站在山巅，但泡泡玛特仍需持续洞察未来审美与情绪，找到接替LABUBU的新明星，才能保持当前的势头。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  如何看美债近期抛售？瑞银：主因“经济衰退”概率降低，并非外资抛售或债务失控等宏大叙事 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">近期美债市场经历剧烈波动，2年期美债收益率过去一个月飙升42个基点，10年、30年期美债收益率分别突破4.3%和4.5%心理关口。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，针对市场热议的“外资撤离美债”“美国债务危机”等结构性解释，瑞银全球利率策略团队在最新报告中指出，<strong>本轮美债抛售的核心驱动力实为周期性因素——美国“经济衰退”概率降低，而非市场担忧的长期结构性风险。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">“经济<strong>衰退</strong>”<strong>概率下降</strong>，2年期美债成市场风暴眼</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">瑞银研报指出，关于长期利率上行的结构性解释如外资撤离、赤字担忧等甚嚣尘上，但通过拆解收益率曲线发现，当前市场波动主要集中在反应周期性叙事的2年期美债收益率上。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">自4月30日以来，2年期美债收益率飙升42个基点，这主要是由于市场对2025年美联储降息幅度的预期减少50个基点。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">与此同时，美债2年期与5年期、5年期与10年期以及10年期与30年期收益率利差仅温和趋平，这些利差在过去一个月的波动幅度均未超过10个基点。<strong>这表明本轮美债波动主因为“经济衰退”概率的变化，而非持久的结构性转变。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ac061e9b-9b04-44b5-846f-f08b1a18808d.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="455" data-wscnw="527"/></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #948f8f;">图1：近期市场波动集中在2年期，显示周期性因素（衰退概率下降）主导抛售</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">债市结构性压力并不明显</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">针对市场热议的美债危机，瑞银指出，从更长期来看美债确实出现了结构性变化，但并非近期出现。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">瑞银报告显示，当前美债2年期与5年期利差与短端利率的关系已回归至2015年前水平，结束了过去十年相对于利率水平而言极为平坦的收益率曲线。但这一关系变化主要发生在2024年，而非近期。这表明曲线陡峭化是市场机制的自然调整，而非债务危机驱动。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/308b9725-79ee-4ad3-9a08-d070e6b1265a.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="445" data-wscnw="1061"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #b3b3b3;">图3：利率曲线形态回归至2015年前水平；图4：美债“期限溢价”攀升</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">瑞银认为，从目前水平看，利率不太可能大幅走高，30年期债券收益率接近5%时可能为长期投资者提供有吸引力的入场机会。短期风险主要来自未来几个月可能走高的CPI数据。</p>

Title:  昔日碳化硅巨头Wolfspeed准备申请破产，美股盘后跳水60% 
Description:  <p>半导体供应商Wolfspeed正准备申请破产保护，股价暴跌超60%，看空期权交易创纪录。</p>
<p>5月20日美股盘后，据媒体报道，<strong>美国芯片制造商Wolfspeed公司正准备在数周内申请破产保护，该公司正艰难应对其债务危机</strong>。在拒绝了债权人提出的多项庭外债务重组方案后，该公司计划申请第11章破产保护，这一申请将得到其大多数债权人的支持。</p>
<p>作为碳化硅芯片制造商，Wolfspeed本月早些时候已表达了对自身持续经营能力的担忧，并预测其年收入将低于预期。公司预计2026年收入将达到8.5亿美元，但这一数字远低于分析师预期的9.587亿美元。而<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3744178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">此前3月底</a>，Wolfspeed芯片法案拨款悬而未决以及可转债再融资遇阻曾暴跌50%。周二破产重组消息后，美股盘后，Wolfspeed跳水60%。<img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/de64a7b8-d833-4302-a1dd-d086e16917b0.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="505" data-wscnw="695"/></p>
<p>根据媒体报道，周二有交易者大幅增加了对Wolfspeed的看空押注。接近7万份7月到期的看跌期权合约（相当于700万股股票）交易活跃，大部分交易发生在市场收盘前的最后半小时。看跌期权交易总量创下363,000手的历史纪录，如果这一价格水平在周三保持，看跌期权买家可能会获得丰厚利润。</p>
<h2>昔日碳化硅巨头，如今破产在即</h2>
<p>作为拥有全球首家8英寸碳化硅晶圆厂的碳化硅巨头，Wolfspeed曾名噪一时。</p>
<p>Wolfspeed原为Cree主营第三代化合物半导体业务的部门，公司技术最初商业化应用于LED市场，致力于推动LED照明变革。</p>
<p>自2017年以来，Cree开始战略性转型，将发展重心转移至Wolfspeed部门，为其核心功率和射频业务提供发展基金。2021年10月Cree正式更名为Wolfspeed，专注于第三代化合物半导体领域的开发与创新。</p>
<p>在过去几年里，新能源汽车、光伏、储能、工业控制等领域对碳化硅半导体应用的需求，确实给Wolfspeed带来巨大的想象空间。尤其是这几年发展较为火热的新能源汽车行业对碳化硅大量的需求，更是促进了行业的发展。目前，超过60%的碳化硅需求来自新能源汽车。</p>
<p><strong>在全球碳化硅产业掀起的增资扩产热潮和美国《</strong><span data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;para&#34;,{&#34;tagName&#34;:&#34;p&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;style&#34;:&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;},&#34;namespaceURI&#34;:&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#34;}]"><strong>芯片与科学法案》的推动下，Wolfspeed一马当先，在碳化硅领域投入了大量的资金</strong>。</span>奈尔·雷诺兹曾表示，2021—2024财年是最重要的投资时期，公司正在执行产能扩张计划，包括莫霍克谷8英寸碳化硅晶圆厂的产能建设、6英寸碳化硅晶圆厂达勒姆工厂的产能扩充等。另外，Wolfspeed还在建设新的材料工厂（JPSilerCity）。</p>
<p><strong>但好景不长，被认为是碳化硅最大市场的新能源汽车却没有带来想象中的大量订单</strong>。近期，欧美纯电动汽车市场需求放缓，更是让很多汽车制造商推迟了车规级半导体订单。市场调研机构Yole分析数据显示，<strong>从短中期来看，2024年电动汽车市场的需求放缓对SiC器件市场产生了重大影响</strong>。</p>
<p>在过去的一年里，Wolfspeed已经解雇CEO，关闭一家工厂，并裁员20%，以应对其股价自疫情期间达到峰值以来暴跌90%以上的情况。今年3月7日，Wolfspeed在向美国证券交易委员会提交的文件中透露，将再裁员180人，主要在北卡罗来纳州达勒姆和赛勒城的工厂。</p>
<p><strong>投资机构JanaPartners认为，Wolfspeed管理层在资本配置、执行和战略方面的失误导致公司经营出现巨大问题，股价持续崩盘</strong>。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  关税阴霾下，日本出口连续第二个月放缓 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">日本政府周三公布的数据显示，该国4月出口同比增长2%，为连续第二个月放缓。这是自去年10月以来的最低增速，也是自去年9月出口萎缩1.7%后的最差表现。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">同时，日本当月进口同比萎缩2.2%，降幅小于预期的4.5%。日本贸易逆差缩小至1158亿日元（约8.031亿美元），低于预期的2271亿日元，3月贸易逆差为5594亿日元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">关税冲击下，日本4月GDP数据陷入萎缩。日本政府初步数据显示，今年第一季度实际国内生产总值按年率计算萎缩0.7%，主要受到私人消费停滞和出口增长放缓的拖累。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">关税高压政策：日本制造业承压</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">媒体报道指出，<strong>当前，日本对美国的汽车、钢铁和铝材出口正面临25%的高额关税。海关数据显示，汽车是日本对美最大的出口商品，2024年占所有对美出口的28.3%。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">作为美国的关键盟友，日本同时还受到特朗普对大多数贸易伙伴征收的10%基准关税的影响。此外，日本商品还面临24%的“对等关税”，不过这部分关税目前已被暂时搁置。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普政府于4月2日对包括日本在内的180多个国家征收“对等关税”，随后设置了“90天关税宽限期”，允许贸易伙伴与其进行贸易谈判。而关税的不确定性对依赖出口的日本经济构成了持续风险，日本出口导向型企业或面临的进一步盈利压力。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title:  华硕CEO：AI PC仍需1-2年才能实现 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">在关税冲击与AI技术生态滞后的双重压力下，AI PC（人工智能电脑）行业正仍然面临挑战。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据彭博社报道，华硕CEO胡书宾（Samson Hu）在接受采访时坦言，AI PC还需一两年才能兑现承诺，新一代AI PC可能需要等到2026年或更晚才能推动市场发展。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尽管各大厂商包括华硕和联想集团去年接连推出AI PC，但这并未能提振低迷的笔记本市场。更雪上加霜的是，美国新政府最近宣布的一系列关税政策，进一步降低了今年的市场预期。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>胡书宾表示，华硕可能考虑将美国售价上调多达10%以抵消关税成本。他直言：“PC行业市场增长率的最初估计约为5%，但由于关税政策的不确定性，现在大多数估计已经降至1%或2%，甚至可能持平。”</strong>这一悲观预测反映了整个科技行业对贸易摩擦升级的担忧。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这位掌舵全球前五大PC厂商的CEO透露，消费者对电脑的支出受制于全球经济担忧和关税影响，同时，因为现有软件尚不成熟，人工智能未能如预期般吸引用户。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">胡书宾称，虽然支持AI任务的硬件已经上市销售，包括微软一年前在2024年Computex上推出的Copilot+ PC，但行业可能还需要一到两年时间，直到第三方应用开发者构建能够充分利用这些功能的软件。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">那為何看到特朗普展板上的第一行給中國加徵34%的關稅，彭先生「還挺高興」？因為，同樣一張展板上，第三行的越南，被加徵了46%的關稅。「第一反應是中國又有優勢了，所以我心態放得很平，既然是無差別攻擊，那麼對中國反而是好事」。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">「別忘了，關稅已經不是第一天的事了」，彭先生介紹過去幾年間中國外貿江湖的一個大變化——特朗普第一任期的貿易戰後，不少企業就已開始試探性外遷，只是當時東南亞的產業鏈配套尚未成熟。隨著時間推移，越南已形成相對完善的供應鏈體系，到去年其所處的傢具品類已基本完成大規模轉移。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">但是這種轉移對「大魚」和「小魚」而言不能一概而論。大型工貿一體企業憑借國內外雙供應鏈佈局更具抗風險能力；小型企業由於缺乏轉移能力，面臨的關稅風險大得多。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">彭先生處在中間，雖然也有越南的生產渠道，但主要從中國發貨，因此他看重的不是美國施加了多少關稅，而是那些先一步佈局越南的同行們（其中不少是他的江浙同鄉），面臨更高還是更低的關稅成本。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">「有個廣泛的誤解，就是越南勞動力成本更低」，彭先生解釋，行內人測算，越南工人月薪為3000元人民幣，但跟中國工人的工作市場、熟練程度、吃苦耐勞程度都沒法比，實際效率要打七折，因此3000除以0.7，相當於4300元月薪，跟長三角的普工薪資已經差別不大。而且跨文化溝通不容易，使生產損耗更高，越南生產成本實際已高於中國。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">而且過去幾年，中國工廠的湧入，使越南土地租金從2022年的每月15元 /㎡ 暴漲至35 元/㎡，用工成本變得更高了。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">所以，如果特朗普真的對越南加的關稅比對中國更高，那麼中國的成本優勢反而凸顯出來，彭先生的「高興」即來自這裡。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">數據似乎也暗示著中-越-美之間的貿易關係。2025年第一季度，河內自北京進口商品約300億美元，而對華盛頓的出口則達到314億美元。事實上，如今中國大約四分之一的出口貨物都需經由包括越南、柬埔寨在內的中間國家轉運。</p></div><figure class="bbc-1qn0xuy"><div class="bbc-j1srjl"

e17g058b0">然而，彭先生的好心情僅僅持續了一周——4月9日下午特朗普宣佈，暫緩徵收對越南等國的高額關稅，在接下來90天內，只徵收相同的10%「基準關稅」。但對中國的關稅不僅沒取消，還加碼到145%的高位。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">「我們就完全喪失掉了出貨的慾望」，彭先生用旗下的一把辦公椅舉例——國內採購成本約30美元，終端售價通常在45-50美元區間浮動。對華關稅最高點，差不多成本驟增35-40美元，迫使終端定價飆升至80美元以上；而越南同行憑借10% 的關稅優勢，同類產品報價可穩定在55-60美元，兩相比較，從中國出貨，成本上已不可行了。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">對於貿易商而言，日子還能忍，「大不了這幾個月先不做了」，但是對於機器轟鳴的工廠而言是「絕望時刻」。彭先生介紹，比較殘酷的一個例子是，當關稅漲到145%了以後，他拿著原本合作的中國工廠的樣品，直接寄給越南工廠來做，中國整個工廠只好突然停掉，因為小虧了話大家分擔一下，如果關稅那麼高，就完全沒辦法，所以工人全部放假，僅僅維持最低運作狀態，這個狀態可能維持幾個月，如果再不好轉，就關掉工廠，所以當時業界估計7、8月失業率可能會比較高。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">但需要提醒的是，彭先生代表的跨境電商雖然重要，但不是中美貿易的全部。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">出口服務商GenPark的創始人兼CEO龐國強（Chris Pang）向BBC中文表示，彭先生這類的跨境電商，在中國對美出口上基本是「三分天下佔其一」，而且相比於傳統外貿，其增速極快，2023年出口增長將近20%。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">龐國強（Chris Pang）表示，過去一個多月，他們大概有10萬家之眾，主要集中在長三角和珠三角，以消費電子、快消品、家居及美妝等「輕快」產品為主，契合電商「小批量、快速迭代」模式，有效地補充了傳統汽車、機械等重工業出口的結構短板。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">工廠停擺的一個月，老闆們最關心的問題是「要不要去越南」。經常往返中越之間的彭先生認為為時已晚，因為一方面越南的各項成本已經高了不少，越南明顯過熱，它完全依賴兩國和美國間的關稅差。而且投資落地要一兩年，但是政策變化「一月三變」，等到了越南，說不定你錢投下去了，訂單又回到中國。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">果不其然，5月12日，中美代表在瑞士會談後，發表聯合聲明，145%的關稅降低到</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">30%，另有24%的關稅暫緩90天徵收。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">雖然依然比越南高，但彭先生表示貿易商們測算過，兩國對美關稅差，大概有40%左右的臨界點，如果超過了，生意做不成，現在只有20%左右，「大家都要出貨了」。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">這個差值除了剛才說的越南土地、人工上漲，以及跨國溝通成本，還有兩邊工廠主的心態不一樣：越南那邊報價都不會太低；而中國的工廠主現在心態是只要不虧錢，甚至稍微虧一點點我都給你做，只為讓工廠保持運轉。由此進一步加大了兩邊的差距。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">「4月9日對華關稅陡升，很多貨都出不去，倉庫里大量庫存；現在突然降關稅，大家都加緊出貨，因為海外倉庫都快見底了；最明顯的證據是，海運價格長得很快，六月初估計要4000美金。」</p></div><figure class="bbc-1qn0xuy"><div class="bbc-j1srjl"

e17g058b0">關稅帶來的擾動，對貿易商來說，不是好消息。對美國消費者來說也一樣。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">彭先生認為，這次其實價格還沒來得及漲，因為如果無利可圖，中國不發貨，越南發；而如果美國執意要把越南、柬埔寨乃至更多的路都堵了，那美國消費者就會面臨一個硬生生漲價的局面。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">因為背後鏈條很簡單——中國/越南工廠、貿易商、亞馬遜的網購頁面——當貿易商們無法通過繞路規避關稅成本，他們會直接修改上調頁面上的售價。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">對於10萬家中國跨境電商而言，90天後，如果關稅恢復，他們可能要去東南亞的工廠提貨，否則還是在中國。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">更痛苦的是生產者，他們既不敢貿然出海，又不甘留下來面對更多不確定性。而且有兩個關稅以外的大背景：「中國供應鏈過剩顯而易見」，即便不考慮關稅因素，由於競爭太激烈，利潤很微薄；另一方面，還要疊加美國人的通貨膨脹，使他們減少了非剛需品的消費，需求也弱了。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">而特朗普的高關稅，加劇了這種供大於求的局面。彭先生的悲觀在於，即便90天後降低關稅，壓低價格以刺激美國消費市場，那麼中國供應鏈的充足產能仍將導致行業陷入 「以價換量」 的惡性循環。貿易商為維持高週轉，只能持續壓縮利潤空間，最終行業整體仍處於供過於求的狀態 —— 區別僅在於過剩規模的大小而已。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">彭先生回憶，從行業親歷者視角看，關稅並非決定市場興衰的核心變量，2018 年中美貿易戰加徵25%關稅，但同時疫情後美國政府向消費者發放現金補貼，跨境電商反而迎來爆發式增長，這一現象揭示了關鍵邏輯：美國市場的需求韌性本質上取決於消費者購買力 —— 當居民可支配收入增加時，商品來源不過是 「中國直發」 或 「越南中轉」 的形式差異；若消費力萎縮，即便實現本土化生產或零關稅，也難以扭轉頹勢。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">換言之，美國消費者的錢包厚度才是驅動貿易的底層變量。無論供應鏈節點如何遷移，「中國製造」 的性價比優勢始終通過產能規模、產業配套等維度實現傳導 —— 在彭先生看了關稅無法改變這一點。</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">作為行業的服務商，龐國強（Chris Pang）反而認為，中小跨境電商比傳統貿易商更有韌性、更靈活，在過去一個多月的衝擊中，他們已經開始調整，比如分散渠道，從沃爾瑪、亞馬遜，擴展到TikTok和獨立站等；再比如，開始研究泰國、墨西哥設立貼牌廠的可能，甚至走的比較靠前的，已經開始介入AI技術，成功實現在庫存管理、物流優化和營銷策略等方面的降本增效，「所以路很多，還是有希望做下去的」。</p></div></main><p><strong><a

Description: <div>Data: <a href="https://www.tpl.org/parkscore" target="_blank">Trust for Public Land</a>; Chart: Kavya Beheraj/Axios</div><p>Washington, D.C. is once again home to the country's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/best-worst-cities-public-parks-us" target="_blank">best city park system</a>, a new ranking finds.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>City parks serve as community meeting spots and civic spaces, offer room for exercise and fresh air, and can draw in new residents — but they require investment, attention and protection.</p><hr><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>That's according to the <a href="https://www.tpl.org/parkscore" target="_blank">2025 ParkScore index</a>, an annual ranking from the Trust for Public Land (TPL), a pro-park nonprofit.</p><ul><li>The report ranks the 100 most populous U.S. cities' park systems relative to one another based on five categories: acreage, access, amenities, investment and equity.</li></ul><p><strong>What they found: </strong>D.C. took home top honors with a total of 85.5 points, thanks in part to big access and investment scores.</p><ul><li>Irvine, California, came in second, while Minneapolis ranked third.</li><li>St. Paul, Minnesota, sits in fifth — meaning the Twin Cities remain a <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/05/22/minneapolis-st-paul-best-park-system-ranking-equity" target="_blank">solid option for park lovers</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>Irvine jumped from fourth place in 2024 to second this year — "propelled," TPL says, by "continued progress on its <a href="https://cityofirvine.org/news-media/press/article/89536" target="_blank">'Great Park</a>,' one of the most ambitious public park projects in the country."</p><ul><li>Denver's now in the top 10 (up from 13th last year), while Cincinnati moved from eighth to fourth.</li></ul><p><strong>Stunning stats: </strong>Among the cities analyzed, $12.2 billion was invested in park and recreation systems in 2024, while 76% of residents now live within a 10-minute walk of a park.</p><ul><li>Those are both records since TPL started tracking such figures in 2007 and 2012, respectively.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next: </strong>Some of the money cities are spending on public parks lately is tied to pandemic-era <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/15/biden-signs-infrastructure-bill-law" target="_blank">federal infrastructure funding</a>, which won't last forever.</p><ul><li>"It'll be interesting to see over the next couple of years, if there aren't replacement funds ... what that will mean for cities and communities that are really wanting to invest in parks," TPL president and CEO Carrie Besnette Hauser tells Axios. </li></ul>

Title: The age when your workout routine is most at risk
Description: <p>New research says 49 is the age when physical activity markedly declines.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Putting a number on when <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/06/axios-finish-line-reader-favorite-workouts-plank-water-aerobics-pickleball" target="_blank">exercise</a> drops off could encourage people to establish active habits early — before brain changes can make it harder to get moving.</p><hr><p><strong>"We've always said this phrase,</strong> 'Physical activity declines with age.' It's really nice to be able to put a number to it," said Timothy Morris, an assistant professor of physical therapy, human movement and rehabilitation sciences at Northeastern University.</p><ul><li>Morris co-authored <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40244567/" target="_blank">the study</a>, which builds on a body of longevity <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e007423" target="_blank">research</a> showing it's hard to maintain a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790798" target="_blank">physically active lifestyle</a> as we age. Some evidence points to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/14/scientists-find-humans-age-dramatically-in-two-bursts-at-44-then-60-aging-not-slow-and-steady" target="_blank">ages 44 and 60</a> as times of accelerated aging.</li></ul><p><strong>What they did: </strong>Researchers analyzed MRI scans and self-reported activity levels from adults ages 18 to 81. 52% were female and 48% male.</p><p><strong>What they found: </strong>Physical activity drops off suddenly around age 49.</p><ul><li>The study used <a href="https://cam-can.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/aboutus/" target="_blank">data</a> from nearly 600 people in and around Cambridge, U.K., so the findings may not apply broadly.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>The brain could be<strong> </strong>partly to blame for a drop in exercise, Morris said.</p><ul><li>When you age, the part of the brain that helps control impulses — the "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/salience-network#:~:text=The%20salience%20network%20is%20a%20collection%20of,of%20the%20brain&#x27;s%20response%20to%20those%20stimuli.&amp;text=The%20salience%20network%20(SN)%20is%20a%20large%2Dscale,nodes%20in%20affect%20and%20reward%20processing%20systems." target="_blank">salience network</a>" — changes.</li><li>So at a certain point, your brain won't naturally "inhibit that desire to sit on the sofa," Morris says.</li></ul><h2>How can we get motivated to move, despite a desire to stay put?</h2><p><strong>Start young.</strong></p><ul><li>During childhood is best. Kids who play sports growing up are more likely to be physically active as adults, studies <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-19050-3" target="_blank">find</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Make it fun.</strong></p><ul><li>Opting to be active simply because it feels good might help you bypass the innate human desire to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6172040/" target="_blank">minimize effort</a>, Morris said.</li><li>Morris is finding preliminary evidence that offering adults "points" for exercising (equivalent to a few cents) gets people out the door. And it seems to be much more effective at getting people moving than reminding them of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/20/exercise-memory-study-walking-recall" target="_blank">health benefits</a> of exercising.</li></ul><p><strong>What we're watching: </strong>A postdoc in Morris' lab is focused on the connection between exercise and brain changes specific to perimenopause, a topic that's gotten more <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2472159-were-finally-learning-how-perimenopause-profoundly-changes-the-brain/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cbrain%20fog%E2%80%9D%20that%20many,such%20as%20your%20spouse&#x27;s%20name." target="_blank">research</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/menopause-laws-map" target="_blank">legal attention</a> lately.</p>
