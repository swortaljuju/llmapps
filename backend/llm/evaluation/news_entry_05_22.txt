<p>Cabello claimed these “mercenaries” are part of a plan to destabilize the country.</p>

<p>“<strong>We have given instructions that all flights from Colombia to Venezuela be immediately suspended because the information we have is related to this type of movement of people,</strong>” Cabello <a href="https://youtu.be/G4aVIRLxCJQ?si=bUBacJLRHU9RaNVe&t=772">said</a> in a televised broadcast.</p>

<p>“These are people who come with clear objectives and will enter Venezuela like any other tourist,” he added.</p>

<p>The elections for governors, state legislators, and National Assembly deputies are marked with questions about the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro’s presidency following allegations of electoral fraud and state repression after the July 2024 presidential elections.</p>

<p><strong>A May <a href="https://www.oas.org/fpdb/press/Report_2025.pdf">report</a> from the Organization of American States documented an increase in human rights violations targeting the opposition, including the state’s use of widespread enforced disappearance as a tool of repression.</strong></p>

<p>The report said electoral repression in Venezuela has reached a critical turning point and gave examples such as state-confirmed murder of protesters, an unprecedented scale of arbitrary detention accompanied by reports of torture and sexual violence, as well as the formal integration of “Colectivos”—armed civilian groups that function as state-enabled actors engaging in home invasions, beatings, arrests, and extrajudicial killings.</p>

<h2>38 People Arrested</h2>

<p>In his broadcast, Cabello also stated that the Venezuelan regime has arrested 38 people in recent days, of whom 17 are foreigners and 21 are Venezuelans. The broadcast, without presenting evidence, said the individuals had intended to detonate explosives in Venezuelan consulates, hospitals, and public service entities, as well as to attack officials of the current Venezuelan regime, with the aim of “sabotaging” the legislative and regional elections.</p>

<p>Cabello, also without providing evidence, accused Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado and Iván Simonovis Aranguren, a former political prisoner living in the United States, of participating in “conspiracy and terrorism” activities against Venezuela.</p>

<p><strong>Machado and Simonovis have not responded to Cabello’s statements and did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.</strong></p>

<p>The Colombian Foreign Ministry <a href="https://x.com/CancilleriaCol/status/1924577877367906719">confirmed</a> in a statement posted on social media platform X that it had received information from the Venezuelan regime to suspend general and commercial aviation flights from Colombia for national security reasons until 6 p.m. May 26. “To date, the Colombian Foreign Ministry has not received information regarding the arrest of Colombian citizens,” it said.</p>

<p><strong>LATAM Airlines Colombia announced in a <a href="https://www.latamairlines.com/co/es/prensa/comunicados/latam-airlines-colombia-informa-sobre-sus-vuelos-entre-bogota-y-caracas">statement</a> the cancellation of flights between Venezuela and Colombia from May 19 to May 26, following the Venezuelan regime’s decision.</strong></p>

<p>Another airline, Avianca, <a href="https://x.com/aviancateguia/status/1924667041564237880/photo/1">announced</a> the cancellation of flights on the Colombia–Venezuela route from May 20 to 25.</p>

Title: Supreme Court: Children Of Illegal Aliens Or Tourists Are Not U.S. Citizens
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Supreme Court: Children Of Illegal Aliens Or Tourists Are Not U.S. Citizens</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/05/supreme_court_children_of_illegal_aliens_or_tourists_are_not_u_s_citizens.html">Authored by Gabriel Canaan via American Thinker</a>,</em></p>

<p>On the very day Donald Trump became president again, <strong>he signed an executive order prospectively eliminating birthright citizenship for children born to aliens unlawfully present in the United States.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/gavel1.JPG?itok=xe0Y7Ydz" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gavel1.JPG?itok=xe0Y7Ydz"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c87b659d-a0ba-4e01-b703-9c41859759bb" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="317" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gavel1.JPG?itok=xe0Y7Ydz" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Immediately, lawsuits were filed in a half-dozen jurisdictions across the country challenging this order.</strong></p>

<p>The groups bringing these suits claim the order disrupts long-standing legal norms governing citizenship. Yet, in fact, Trump’s contention — that birthright citizenship is not possessed by children of illegal aliens under the “correct interpretation of the law” — is exactly right.</p>

<p><strong>Birthright citizenship is conventionally understood to apply to any child born in the United States</strong>, regardless of the immigration status of that child’s parents. This view is based on the common law principle of <em>jus soli </em>(“right of soil”), which is said to be incorporated in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <strong>This understanding of the Citizenship Clause, however, despite its prevalence in academia and political commentary, is based on a mistaken and incomplete reading of controlling Supreme Court precedent.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, birthright citizenship, as provided for in the Citizenship Clause, as that clause has been authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court, is possessed only by children born in the United States to at least one parent who is lawfully residing in the United States.</p>

<p>Ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War with the aim of remedying the injustices of the <em>Dred Scott </em>decision, <strong>the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to “all persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”</strong> This latter phrase has been wrongly equated with “subject to the <em>laws</em> thereof,” and thus to entail that all persons born in the United States are U.S. citizens, <strong>with only a few narrow exceptions, such as children born to diplomats.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yet the Supreme Court has construed the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” more narrowly, most notably in seminal cases that have been taught — well or ill — in law schools ever since.</strong></p>

<p>In the 1884 case <em>Elk v. Wilkins</em>, decided when American Indians were increasingly integrating into mainstream American society, presented the constitutional issue of whether Indians who had been born within the allegiance of a tribe were “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States at birth, and thus born American citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p><strong>The Court ruled that they were not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States,</strong> on the ground that “jurisdiction” in the Citizenship Clause meant complete jurisdiction, which implied “direct and immediate allegiance” to the United States. The parents of children born in the allegiance of a tribe had only indirect and intermediate allegiance to the United States, through their tribe. (Today, by a subsequent act of Congress, Indians born on reservations are U.S. citizens at birth.)</p>

<p><strong>Twelve years later, in <em>Wong Kim Ark v. United States</em>, the citizenship status of an American-born man of Chinese descent was the issue.</strong></p>

<p>Wong Kim Ark had been born in San Francisco to Chinese nationals, and had been denied entry to the United States after returning from a visit to China as an adult<em>. </em>At the time, Chinese nationals were precluded by treaty from naturalizing as U.S. citizens. Nevertheless, after recounting the history of the common-law <em>jus soli</em> doctrine, and its influence on our Constitution, the Court held that, because the petitioner had been born to parents lawfully residing in the United States, he had been born within the “allegiance and protection” of the United States, and therefore at birth was “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States<strong>. He was thus born a citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment.</strong></p>

<p>That the petitioner’s parents had resided here with the permission of the United States was central to the Court’s holding. <strong>Chinese nationals who remain “subjects of the Emperor of China…are entitled to the protection of and owe allegiance to the United States, <em>so long as they are permitted by the United States to reside</em> <em>here</em>,</strong>” the decision reads, “and are ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,’ in the same sense as all other aliens [lawfully] residing in the United States” (emphasis added). The Court explained that to “reside,” in this usage, means to live in a place with the intent to remain there, but not necessarily indefinitely. It is a broader category than “domiciled,” and could apply to long-term visa holders, as well as to lawful permanent residents.</p>

<p><strong>The Court’s interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment thus limits its application to children of aliens residing in the country with permission.</strong> This requirement implies that children born to foreign nationals living in the country <em>without </em>permission are <em>not</em> subject to its jurisdiction, and that mere tourists, since they are only visiting and do not reside here, also are not so subject. This crucial qualification of common law birthright citizenship by the requirements of both residence and permission therefore excludes from citizenship at birth children both of tourists and of those residing in this country without permission — that is, illegal aliens.</p>

<p><strong>To disregard these requirements would involve interpreting the Court to mean that illegal aliens are within the “allegiance and protection” of the United States.</strong></p>

<p>But the Court specifically stated otherwise, holding that Chinese nationals who were not permitted to reside in the United States were not within its allegiance and protection. The Court could hardly have held otherwise. The phrase “allegiance and protection” describes the reciprocal obligations of citizens and the state that are foundational to a nation. Since illegal aliens are at all times subject to apprehension and deportation, they can hardly be regarded as within the “protection” of the United States.</p>

<p>In further evidence that <em>Wong Kim Ark </em>held that illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for citizenship purposes, the Court cited to its own earlier ruling in another immigration case, from 1893, <em>Fong Yue Ting v. United States</em>. There, the Court addressed the legal status of non-resident or unlawfully-present aliens: while they are subject to our laws, they remain outside the government’s “complete jurisdiction.” Had the Court held in <em>Wong Kim Ark </em>that all children born in the United States and subject to its laws — such as illegal aliens—were citizens, it would have run afoul of the combined holdings of <em>Elk</em> — that jurisdiction for citizenship purposes means complete jurisdiction — and of <em>Fong Yue Ting </em>— that illegal aliens and non-resident aliens are outside the complete jurisdiction of the United States. The residence and permission requirements of <em>Wong Kim Ark</em> are therefore necessary to harmonize that case with those prior cases.</p>

<p><em>Wong Kim Ark</em>’s inclusion of residence and permission requirements marks the Court’s departure from the English common law understanding of birthright citizenship in favor of one more compatible with American constitutional principles.</p>

<p>Indeed, <strong>leading constitutional scholars at the time noted that the American approach required residence while the British did not.</strong></p>

<p>The doctrine of <em>jus soli</em> as articulated by common law scholars such as Coke and Blackstone is a product of feudalism: a subject owes a duty of perpetual loyalty to the Crown under the protection of which he is born.</p>

<p>In stark contrast, the American Revolution severed the colonies’ duty to the king in favor of a compact operating by consent of the governed rather than by perpetual, unchosen duty. The purpose of the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment was not to reinstate the common law version of birthright citizenship; rather, it was to extend the principles of the Declaration of Independence to freed slaves and to nonwhite immigrants such as Chinese-Americans.</p>

<p>As it is currently applied, <strong>birthright citizenship not only returns us to a feudal past, but also undermines the ability of the people of the United States to set forth standards by which children born to foreign nationals may become citizens</strong>. It incentivizes “birth tourism” and mass illegal immigration, both of which treat the United States as a provider of material benefits rather than a political community towards which one owes allegiance and duties. Unlike illegal aliens and temporary guests, lawful permanent residents are incentivized to invest in their political community, and to adopt the customs and civic responsibilities of that community. Their children’s subsequent inheritance of those responsibilities further facilitates assimilation and social cohesion.</p>

<p>The rule of <em>Wong Kim Ark v. United States</em> reflects the compact approach to self-government inherent in the founding principles of this country while serving the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Applying the rule as it was intended to be understood would remedy the above-mentioned policy deficiencies of an over-expansive view of birthright citizenship without the need to amend the Constitution, and efficiently resolve the flurry of lawsuits against President Trump’s executive order.</p>

Title: Senate Nullifies California's Signature Gas-Car Ban, Sends Bill To Trump
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Senate Nullifies California's Signature Gas-Car Ban, Sends Bill To Trump</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>The U.S. Senate voted 51–44 to overturn California's ban on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, sending the measure to President Trump's desk for signature.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/GrkALekWQAAy7YS-1.png?itok=A3hagDh2" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/GrkALekWQAAy7YS-1.png?itok=A3hagDh2"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c3933174-50ea-4477-ba2c-392e9398f099" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="285" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GrkALekWQAAy7YS-1.png?itok=A3hagDh2" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The vote nullifies a Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency waiver that allowed California to set stricter emission standards than federal rules under the Clean Air Act. The vote also marks a significant blow to leftist climate radicals pushing de-growth green policies aimed at shaping vehicle emission standards at a national level. </p>

<p>Nearly all Democrats voted against repealing the EV mandate, except Senator Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who broke ranks to support the measure—likely due to her home state's deep ties to America's legacy automakers in Detroit. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) blasted the Biden-era EPA waiver, calling it an "attempt by the Biden administration to impose an electric vehicle mandate across the country." </p>

<p>As of May, eleven states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. The new requirements faced strong opposition from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto trade group representing BMW, Ferrari, Ford, General Motors, Honda, and many other manufacturers. Also, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued the 2035 target was unrealistic and would harm the economy because it was de-growth in nature. </p>

<p>Republicans, led by West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, called Biden-era EPA waiver a federal overreach and a threat to consumer choice and jobs. </p>

<p>"Today, the Senate voted to end California's EV mandate and send my joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA to President Trump's desk. The Biden administration and Congressional Democrats tried to block the will of the American people from this attempt by extreme unelected California and Biden EPA bureaucrats to ban gas-powered cars throughout the country, but Congress has now spoken and soundly rejected this rule," Capito stated. </p>

<p>She continued, "The impact of California's waiver would have been felt across the country, harming multiple sectors of our economy and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. I'm proud to have led this effort to protect American workers and consumers from this radical and drastic policy." </p>

<p>Democrats in the Senate are watching key climate policies—linked to the Green New Deal—begin to unravel under President Trump's first four months in office. The rollback is evident not only in the automotive sector, with efforts to block EV mandates, but also in utilities, where fossil fuel generation is desperately needed to stabilize fragile power grids amid the surge in demand from AI data centers and overall electrification trends. </p>

<p>Environmental groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, were furious with the vote, calling the move by Republicans "an unprecedented and reckless attack on states' legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease, and heart conditions." </p>

<p>"It is going nuclear," Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday evening, adding this would enable MAGA Republicans to hijack the rules, erode "away at the Senate and undermine this institution they claim to care about."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the climate change policies have sparked a number of national security threats, first being the potential for unreliable power grids, plus flooding the nation with foreign solar panels has created a major issue:</p>

</ul><p>And risk plunging into a net-zero death like Spain several weeks ago... </p>

</ul><p>All in all, the Trump administration is bringing back energy policy common sense after four years of disastrous climate change nonsense that only boosted inflation. </p>

<p>President Trump has finally weighed in with a lengthy Truth Social post after his "Big, Beautiful Bill" narrowly cleared the House in a last-minute 215–214 vote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL" has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country! The Bill includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome, "TRUMP Savings Accounts" for newborn babies, and much more! Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination. They have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election, and are warped in the past, hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the World's criminals to be able to pour into our Country, men to be able to play in women's sports, and transgender for everybody. They don't realize that these things, and so many more like them, will NEVER AGAIN happen!</em></p>

<p>President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax package—also known as the "Big, Beautiful Bill"—cleared the House in a <strong>last-minute 215–214 vote on Thursday morning</strong>. The bill now moves to the Senate, where Republicans are calling for major revisions ahead of an expected vote in August. It aims to prevent a year-end tax hike and a potential debt default but would significantly increase the near-term federal deficit.</p>

The university has <strong>72 hours to hand over requested information.</strong></p>

<p>The decision followed a back-and-forth in recent days over the legality of a wide-ranging records request by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, <strong>existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status, </strong>the notice reads.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In April DHS threatened to block Harvard from enrolling international students if the university refused to hand over detailed records about the student body containing "relevant information" on student visa holders who have been involved in "known illegal" or "dangerous" activity.</p>

<p>"<strong>It is a privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee,</strong>" Noem wrote in an April <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/17/us/harvard-letter-signed.html">letter</a>. "The United States government understands that Harvard University relies heavily on foreign student funding from over 10,000 foreign students to build and maintain their substantial endowment."</p>

<p><strong>Harvard dug in last month </strong>following the Trump admin's demands - with president Alan Garber saying in a statement "No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue."</p>

<h2>Not So Fast?</h2>

<p>Concurrently, a federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of international students nationwide while a court case challenging previous terminations is pending.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The order by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Oakland <strong>bars the government from arresting or incarcerating the plaintiffs and similarly situated students</strong>; from transferring any of them outside the jurisdiction of their residence; from imposing any adverse legal effect on students and from reversing the reinstatement of the legal status until the case is resolved. Students can still be arrested for violent crimes. -<a href="https://apnews.com/article/students-trump-administration-arrest-deportation-7fc4cb9ebc1b10d3ec0d564313067846">AP</a></em></p>

<p>According to White, the government's actions "wreaked havoc not only on the lives of Plaintiffs here but on similarly situated F-1 nonimmigrants across the United States and continues do so."</p>

<p>Read Noem's letter below (emphasis ours):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program Decertification</strong></p>

<p>I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked.</p>

<p><strong>As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enroll foreign students</strong>, and it is also a privilege to employ aliens on campus. All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program regulations, to maintain this privilege. As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-llamas sympathies, and employs racist "diversity, equity, and inclusion" policies, you have lost this privilege.</p>

<p>The revocation of your Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification means that <strong>Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year</strong>. This decertification also means that <strong>existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status.</strong></p>

<p>This action should not surprise you and is the unfortunate result of Harvard's failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.</p>

<p><strong>On April 16, 2025, I requested records</strong> pertaining to nonimmigrant students enrolled at Harvard University, including information regarding misconduct and other offenses that would render foreign students inadmissible or removable. On April 30, 2025, Harvard's counsel provided information that he represented as responsive to my request. It was not.</p>

<p>As a courtesy that Harvard was not legally entitled to, the Acting DHS General Counsel responded on my behalf and afforded Harvard another opportunity to comply. Harvard again provided an insufficient response.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences must follow to send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that the Trump Administration will enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses.</strong></p>

<p>If Harvard would like the opportunity of regaining Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification before the upcoming academic school year, you must provide all of the information requested below <strong>within 72 hours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please be</strong> advised that providing materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent information may subject you to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Other criminal and civil sanctions may also apply.</p>

<p><strong>I expect full and complete responses to the following requests:</strong></p>

<ol><li>Any and all records, whether official or informal, in the possession of Harvard University, including electronic records and audio or video footage, regarding illegal activity whether on or off campus, by a nonimmigrant student enrolled in Harvard University in the last five years.</li>
	<li>Any and all records, whether official or informal, in the possession of Harvard University, including electronic records and audio or video footage, regarding dangerous or violent activity whether on or off campus, by a nonimmigrant student enrolled in Harvard University in the last five years.</li>
	<li>Any and all records, whether official or informal, in the possession of Harvard University, including electronic records and audio or video footage, regarding threats to other students or university personnel whether on or off campus, by a nonimmigrant student enrolled in Harvard University in the last five years.</li>
	<li>Any and all records, whether official or informal, in the possession of Harvard University, including electronic records and audio or video footage, regarding deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel whether on or off campus, by a nonimmigrant student enrolled in Harvard University in the last five years.</li>
	<li>Any and all disciplinary records of all nonimmigrant students enrolled in Harvard University in the last five years.</li>
	<li>Any and all audio or video footage, in the possession of Harvard University, of any protest activity involving a nonimmigrant student on a Harvard University campus in the last five years.</li>

<p>The “safe and effective” narrative collapsed on camera during Senator Ron Johnson’s <strong><a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1rmxPyqrLMYKN">explosive Senate hearing</a></strong> on COVID-19 vaccine injuries Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>Senator Ron Johnson brought the receipts, exposing how the Biden administration DELIBERATELY hid vaccine harms from the public.</strong></p>

<p>Then Dr. James Thorp (OB-GYN) revealed miscarriage data so disturbing, it left the room silent.</p>

<p>This is the Senate hearing they never wanted you to see.<strong> I turned <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1rmxPyqrLMYKN">three hours of footage</a> into a five-minute read.</strong></p>

<p>Senator Ron Johnson opened the hearing with a bombshell: the Biden administration knew about deadly heart risks tied to the COVID shots, and deliberately kept it from the public.</p>

<p>Johnson released newly subpoenaed records exposing a detailed timeline of what officials knew and when. While Pfizer and Moderna received insider updates, doctors and citizens who raised concerns were silenced.</p>

<p>In February 2021, Israeli health officials warned the CDC of “large reports of myocarditis, particularly in young people” following Pfizer injections, just two and a half months after the vaccine received emergency use authorization.</p>

<p><strong>By April, the CDC was already reviewing myocarditis data from Israel and the Department of Defense. But instead of alerting the public, they stayed quiet.</strong></p>

<p>By the end of that month, VAERS had recorded 2,926 deaths, nearly half of which occurred within three days of injection. “Somebody ought to be looking at it,” Johnson said.</p>

<p>In May, the CDC considered issuing a formal health alert—but scrapped it. They replaced it with watered-down guidance that removed a key warning for doctors to restrict physical activity in myocarditis patients.</p>

<p>Francis Collins, then director of the NIH, brushed it all off. “Senator, people die,” he told Johnson.</p>

<p>In just six months, the toll was staggering: 384,270 reports of adverse events, 4,812 deaths, and 1,736 of those occurred within just <strong>48 hours of injection</strong>.</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Dr. Peter McCullough then took the floor and upended the narrative that vaccine-induced myocarditis is “rare.”</p>

<p>Before COVID, McCullough had seen just two myocarditis cases in his entire career. After the rollout, everything changed.</p>

<p><strong>He says he’s now “examined thousands of patients with this problem.”</strong></p>

<p>“There’s 1,065 papers in the peer-reviewed literature on COVID vaccine myocarditis,” he explained, pointing to a 2021 case published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A 42-year-old man developed vaccine-induced myocarditis. “The infection is ruled out,” McCullough said. “It’s the vaccine.” Three days after his Moderna shot, the man was dead.</p>

<p><strong>McCullough cited a shocking case from Korea</strong>—a young man who died within eight hours of hospitalization after a Pfizer shot. His heart had been, in McCullough’s words, “fried with inflammation.”</p>

<p>Then came a case from Connecticut: two teenage boys, 16 and 17, died in their sleep just days after Pfizer. Their parents found them unresponsive.</p>

<p>“These cases… should have gotten everyone’s attention,” McCullough said. “We should never have someone die after taking a vaccine that’s directly caused to the vaccine.”</p>

<p>He now treats teenagers who can’t stand up and previously healthy adults who are suffering strokes with no clear cause.</p>

<p><strong>According to Vaughn, the spike protein’s S1 subunit is far from harmless. “It triggers inflammation, it disrupts endothelial barriers, it induces fibrin resistant to breakdown, and it promotes a lot of amyloid aggregates,” he said.</strong></p>

<p>These effects impair oxygen delivery, damage blood vessels, and trigger a wave of symptoms—racing heart, brain fog, shortness of breath, and post-exertional crashes.</p>

<p>In his clinic, Vaughn uses immunofluorescent microscopy to detect the spike protein’s damage, showing up in patients who were once thriving.</p>

<p>He warned that the mRNA injections led to uncontrolled spike protein production, which spread throughout the body, reaching the heart, brain, ovaries, and testes.</p>

<p>Dr. Thorp pointed to the now-infamous Shimabukuro study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which claimed a 12.6% miscarriage rate following COVID vaccination.</p>

<p>But when you isolate the data for women vaccinated in the first trimester, the miscarriage rate rises to 82%, Dr. Thorp said. This 82% claim remains a topic of debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Attorney Aaron Siri then delivered a little-known history lesson on vaccine liability.</p>

<p>“For every product on the market, you can SUE the manufacturer for harm,” Siri said. “There’s only ONE product in America you CANNOT sue the manufacturer to claim it could have been made safer—and that’s VACCINES.”</p>

<p>He explained how the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act gave pharmaceutical companies sweeping immunity, not just for three vaccines, but for every new childhood shot added to the CDC schedule.</p>

<p>The result? A schedule that exploded from 3 shots to 29 in the first year of life, with zero accountability.</p>

<p>“They don’t have the financial incentive to make them safer,” Siri said. “In fact, they have the disincentive.”</p>

<p><strong>2. Early treatment kept people out of hospitals.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. The virus mutated into a milder form.</strong></p>

<p>By mid-2021, over half the U.S. was “fully vaccinated.” But instead of improving, the numbers got worse.</p>

<p>So his message quietly shifted from “safe and effective” to “<strong>We did our best with what we knew at the time</strong>,” a clear sign that the vaccine narrative is running out of ground to stand on.</p>

Title:  鸿鹄二期资金落地，新华保险公告出资100亿元 
Description:  <p>新华保险最新披露对外投资进展。</p>
<p>2025年5月22日，新华保险出资100亿元认购国丰兴华鸿鹄志远二期私募证券投资基金（以下简称“鸿鹄基金”）的份额。</p>
<p>鸿鹄基金是新华保险与中国人寿共同出资成立的私募产品，基金管理方是国丰兴华私募，同样也是两家险资巨头出资成立的私募平台，专注于二级市场投资。</p>
<p>鸿鹄基金自2024年正式开始以来，成为险资加大中国股票投资的新模式，突破了以往通过保费产品组合、险企自有资金直接投资的方式。</p>
<h2>签订鸿鹄二期合同</h2>
<p>据公告，新华保险与基金管理人国丰兴华及基金托管人广发银行股份有限公司北京分行签署《国丰兴华鸿鹄志远二期私募证券投资基金基金合同》。</p>
<p>根据基金合同，上述二期基金成立规模为200亿元，本公司出资100亿元认购私募基金份额。</p>
<p>结合此前公告，鸿鹄基金二期的认购方穿透后是新华保险旗下的新华资产管理公司，亦有中国人寿旗下的国寿资产管理公司。</p>
<p>基金管理费率为0.10%/年，托管费率为0.002%/年。</p>
<p>上述最新公告标志着，鸿鹄基金二期的资金已经到位，“入市”箭在弦上。</p>
<h2>“入市”买什么资产</h2>
<p>资事堂梳理新华保险历史公告，这家险资曾透露鸿鹄基金二期的投资方向：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“通过低频交易、长期持有的方式以获得稳健股息收益，提升长期投资回报，实现资金保值增值······中证A500指数成分股中符合条件的大型上市公司A+H股。标的公司应当公司治理良好、经营运作稳健、股息相对稳定、股票流动性相对较好，与保险资金长期投资需求相适应”。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>另据公告，上述私募基金存续期限为10年，按照基金合同约定履行相应变更手续后，私募基金存续期限可以相应延长。</p>
<h2>险资巨头联手</h2>
<p>2024年一季度，鸿鹄基金正式成立，第一期规模为500亿元人民币，中国人寿和新华保险各出资500亿元，投资方向是具有较大市值、流动性好以及较高市场影响力的优质上市公司。</p>
<p>实际上，大型险企正在不断推进保险资金投资的改革。</p>
<p>5月22日，金融监管总局新闻发言人、政策研究司司长郭武平在国新办新闻发布会上表示，保险资金长期投资改革试点的首批试点规模为500亿元，第二批试点为1120亿元，最近还要做第三批600亿元的批复，规模合计为2220亿元。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:   结怨特朗普，股价跌跌不休，苹果“摊上事儿了” 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">特朗普公开批评苹果CEO Tim Cook在美国境外建厂之际，苹果股价连续七个交易日下跌。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据彭博5月23日报道，特朗普本月表示他“与Tim Cook之间有一点小问题”，并声称曾要求苹果停止在印度建设工厂。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">与此同时，特朗普曾公开赞扬英伟达CEO出席了沙特投资论坛，但Tim Cook并未出席这场活动。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普与Tim Cook的“矛盾”或已对苹果股价造成冲击。五月初苹果还是全球市值最高的公司，但目前已跌至第三位。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">美东时间5月23日，苹果股价收跌0.36%，延续七连跌颓势，市值较月初蒸发逾3000亿美元，将全球市值王座拱手让与微软、英伟达。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/2709bafe-ef03-463a-9928-9075f893e399.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="488" data-wscnw="687"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普对Tim Cook这一明显带有胁迫性质的言论已经在华尔街引起警觉。Huntington National Bank股票研究主管Randy Hare表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">特朗普不断针对苹果并似乎对他们有所不满，这对我来说是个危险信号。这并不意味着特朗普会采取进一步行动，但你无法预测接下来会发生什么，这让我保持谨慎。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，苹果还面临AI军备竞赛掉队风险、中国市场增长乏力等压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">日前，OpenAI宣布收购苹果前首席设计师艾维的AI硬件初创公司，加剧压垮市场对苹果的信心。分析师普遍认为，苹果在生成式AI领域布局滞后，核心产品线面临颠覆风险。CBOE苹果波动率指数虽从月内高点回落38%，但仍处近三年高位，显示市场对其转型能力的质疑。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，苹果最新财报显示，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">来自大中华区的营收为160.02亿美元同比下降2.26%</a>，叠加中国本土品牌崛起，Tim Cook“东线战略”遭遇严峻考验。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  美债下跌何时会冲击美股？很近了 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">据高盛最新分析，当10年期美债收益率收益率在一个月内上涨约60个基点达到4.75-4.80%时，股市可能面临重大压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月23日周五，美股期货在盘前交易中继续走低，延续了昨日美债拍卖后的大幅下跌态势。这一走势与今晨美国国债收益率的上涨相互呼应。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">数据显示，美债收益率在参议院通过特朗普“大漂亮法案（One Big Beautiful Bill）”后明显攀升。10年期美债收益率现处于4.520%水平附近。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a194b8ec-b8dc-420a-861a-37b2ac4583fb.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="345" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/aa201e1f-0310-4d13-ab0a-8b2455935c2b.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="290" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">而日本债券市场的动荡和英国通胀数据走高进一步推高了全球收益率。在这一背景下，投资者最关心的问题变得非常简单：股市何时会开始对债券收益率上涨产生反应？</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>根据高盛的分析，答案是：就是现在！</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>该行研究发现，当10年期美债收益率在一个月内上涨2个标准差，即收益率在一个月内上涨约60个基点达到4.75-4.80%时，或将冲击股市。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">从历史上看，影响股市的并非只有收益率的绝对水平，重要的还有上涨速度。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这意味着如果当前美债收益率的上涨趋势持续，可能很快就会达到影响股市的临界水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/dee2f204-edef-4b0f-bfe9-ea781366a476.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="300" data-wscnw="500"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">换句话说，我们已经非常接近临界点。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title: Scoop: Primary challengers circle Thomas Massie after Trump-defying vote
Description: <p>President Trump's political operation has been fielding calls from Republicans interested in waging a primary challenge to Kentucky Rep. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/nrcc-trump-hudson-republican-primaries" target="_blank">Thomas Massie</a>, according to a person familiar with the talks.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The conversations are evidence that Trump — and his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/10/trump-maga-inc-power-fundraising" target="_blank">$500 million political apparatus</a> — is actively entertaining the best way to back a primary opponent against Massie, who has drawn Trump's ire for voting against his "one big, beautiful bill."</p><hr><ul><li>"Massie is about to be in the fight of his life," said Kentucky-based GOP strategist Jake Cox. "Just wait until he sees the money a Trump-backed candidate can raise simply from the President saying their name into a camera or opening up his email list."</li><li>Two possible primary challengers being mentioned in Kentucky Republican circles are state Sen. Aaron Reed and state Rep. Kimberly Moser.</li><li>A statewide Kentucky GOP official tells Axios: "Massie has had weak primary opponents in previous cycles and made mincemeat of them, but I think this time is different. Supporting Trump is the No. 1 — and sometimes the only — issue in GOP primaries at the moment."</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying:</strong> Trump has privately wondered what the point is of having a Republican in Massie's seat if "they're going to vote with Democrats and trash Republicans all the time."</p><ul><li>Trump's anger boiled on Tuesday, when he told reporters in the Capitol that the congressman should be "<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/trump-house-republicans-medicaid-salt" target="_blank">voted out of office</a>."</li><li>The president's political lieutenants piled on. "Some guys just prefer to be in the minority," White House deputy chief of staff James Blair said of Massie on X.</li><li>When asked during a Thursday briefing whether Trump believed — as well as Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), who also voted "no" — should be primaried, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: "I believe he does and I believe he does not like to see grandstanders in Congress."</li></ul><p><strong>The background: </strong>Massie and Trump have clashed for years.</p><ul><li>In 2019, Massie joined House Democrats in opposing Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the southern border.</li><li>After Massie opposed a COVID relief package in 2020, Trump called on the congressman to be thrown "out of the Republican Party."</li><li>Massie was one of six House Republicans to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump during the 2024 Republican presidential primary.</li><li>After Massie opposed a Trump-backed government spending bill in March, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the congressman was a "GRANDSTANDER."</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the scenes: </strong>During the transition, Trump privately asked DeSantis for advice on how to deal with Massie.</p><ul><li>"Give him raw milk," DeSantis said, referring to one of Massie's <a href="https://massie.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395642" target="_blank">legislative priorities</a>, according to a person briefed on the conversation.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side: </strong>Massie told Axios he was skeptical Trump allies would find a strong candidate to run against him. </p><ul><li>Massie noted he had easily fended off primary challenges in the last three elections and said his private polling showed him popular in his conservative central Kentucky district.</li><li>"If somebody got in this race and they were a reasonable person, not crazy to run against me, I would call them up and say: 'You know what you should do before you dedicate the next year and a half of your life to getting your a** kicked? You should do a poll,'" Massie said.</li><li>Massie also said Trump's attacks on him were helping him fundraise, pointing out he had raised $47,000 this week and had a series of donor events lined up in California next week.</li><li>The congressman's allies say his independent streak endears him to voters.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>Massie said he spoke to Trump a few weeks before the election and a few weeks after, but not since. After Massie's mother passed away in June 2024, Trump left him a voicemail expressing his condolences, Massie said.</p><ul><li>During the call after the election, Massie told Trump he would be interested in serving as his agriculture secretary, an idea Trump passed on. </li><li>"I would have taken it," Massie said.</li></ul>

Title: "You don't have to die in this place": House Dems want age reckoning after Connolly's death
Description: <p>Some younger House Democrats are preparing to push for a long-delayed, caucus-wide intervention on age after the tragic passing of yet another one of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/gerry-connolly-dies-oversight-committee-virginia" target="_blank">their septuagenarian colleagues</a>, Axios has learned.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The impacts of the party's aging membership were keenly felt Thursday when House Republicans <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/22/house-passes-trumps-big-beautiful-bill" target="_blank">passed their sweeping tax cut bill</a> by just a single vote, 215 to 214.</p><hr><ul><li>Several House Democrats argued that vacancies created by the deaths of Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/13/raul-grijalva-dies-cancer-77" target="_blank">Raúl Grijalva</a> (D-Ariz.) and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/sylvester-turner-house-democrat-texas-dies" target="_blank">Sylvester Turner</a> (D-Texas), all in their 70s, may have been outcome-determinative.</li><li>"You see where we are, we can't afford to lose anymore members. ... We're down three people because they passed away," one lawmaker told Axios just off the floor as the House was voting on the bill.</li><li>Said another ahead of the vote: "The tragic reality is, when ... this vote passes and the difference is the number of members who passed away this Congress, I think it's going to really infuriate many of our supporters."</li></ul><p><strong>By the numbers: </strong>The eight members of Congress who have died in office since November 2022 were all Democrats, with an average age of 75.</p><ul><li>A half dozen of those deaths were just in the 13 months since last April.</li><li>Grijalva's seat won't be filled until a <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2025/03/26/democratic-candidates-lining-up-for-cd7-special-election-to-replace-grijalva" target="_blank">special election</a> is held in late September. Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has scheduled the election for Turner's seat <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/houston/2025/04/08/bayou-buzz" target="_blank">on Nov. 4</a>, to the fury of Democrats.</li><li>Some Democrats fear Virginia's Republican governor may similarly drag his feet on scheduling a contest to replace Connolly.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Of the House's 10 oldest members, seven are Democrats, Axios' <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/congress-ages-gerontocracy-members-gerry-connolly" target="_blank">April Rubin reported</a>.</p><ul><li>"Some folks have given their life to this place, and we're so grateful and commend them for it — you don't have to die in this place," the first House Democrat said. </li><li>"I definitely think that someone in leadership needs to have some hard conversations and say … 'you don't [have to] keep doing this.'"</li></ul><p><strong>State of play: </strong>In interviews with a dozen House Democrats on Wednesday and Thursday, many said the time for those difficult discussions has come.</p><ul><li>Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid thoughts about a highly sensitive topic without facing backlash from their colleagues.</li><li>"This is something that Democrats come up to me [and ask about] all the time, everywhere I go, like, 'You guys need a fresh face. A fresh message and a fresh face,'" said a third House Democrat.</li><li>A fourth told Axios it's nothing personal to older members, but "the people don't own the seats, and we just look so f**king out of touch."</li><li>"I think this could force a conversation," a fifth House Democrat said of Connolly's passing on Wednesday.</li></ul><p><strong>What to watch: </strong>It is not yet clear what reforms younger Democrats will pursue, though several floated a renewed push for committee leadership term limits as a way to incentivize older members to retire.</p><ul><li>Republicans "don't have seniority over there. We do. That could be something that gets discussed," the fifth House Democrat said.</li><li>"The incentives, on our side, cause people to be here a long time," said a sixth lawmaker. "There's a conversation to be had there."</li><li>A seventh told Axios that when committee term limits were instituted in their state legislature, "I think it ended up being for the better. ...

Title: Justin Trudeau Getting Two Pensions And Severance Worth Over $8 Million
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Justin Trudeau Getting Two Pensions And Severance Worth Over $8 Million</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Nothing like being rewarded for a job well done. Or, in Justin Trudeau's case, bringing an entire country to the brink of losing the respect of the entire world.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why Trudeau is reportedly getting not one but <strong>two </strong>pensions, and a $104,000 severance, totaling more than $8 million,  <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/national/justin-trudeau-to-collect-two-pensions-104k-in-severance">according to the Toronto Sun</a>.</p>

<p>The Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) released a chart Wednesday estimating pension and severance payouts for departing MPs.</p>

<p>“Pensions for former MPs depend on length of service and the rules at the time,” said CTF National Director Franco Terrazzano. “When Canadians see some of these numbers, the clear takeaway is that these political pensions are costing taxpayers too much money.”</p>

<p><strong>The Sun <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/national/justin-trudeau-to-collect-two-pensions-104k-in-severance">writes</a> that Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is eligible for two pensions: one for nearly 17 years as an MP and another for his 10 years as PM. Together, they’re valued at about $8.4 million. Starting at age 55, he’ll receive $141,000 annually from his MP pension, and another $73,000 a year from his PM pension when he turns 67.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%209.59.18%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=ZGB5InVi" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%209.59.18%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=ZGB5InVi"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ce0a7c50-6057-4e1b-af0d-059a5021d469" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="286" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20at%209.59.18%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=ZGB5InVi" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></strong></p>

<p>“Trudeau is also going to be getting a severance just shy of $105,000,” Terrazzano added. “When we speak of leadership at the top, the first place for politicians to reign in the perks is to end the second pension for future prime ministers.”</p>

<p>A total of 110 former MPs qualify for either a pension, severance, or both. Those who served fewer than six years are eligible for severance worth half their salary—$104,900.</p>

<p>Notable names entitled to both pension and severance include Niki Ashton, Rachel Blaney, Jagmeet Singh, Seamus O’Regan, and others.</p>

<p>Despite being eligible, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he will refuse his severance.</p>

<p>“There are 13 former MPs who will get an annual starting pension of more than $100,000, while the vast majority of private sector workers don’t even get a workplace pension,” said Terrazzano. “There definitely needs to be a culture change in Ottawa, and that has to start with our elected representatives.”</p>

Title: 8 Habits That Can Add Decades To Life
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">8 Habits That Can Add Decades To Life</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/8-habits-that-can-add-decades-to-life-5852520">Authored by Brendon Fallon and Emily Allison via The Epoch Times</a> (emphasis ours),</em></p>

<p>We all want to live as long and as healthily as possible. Many healthy living hacks, such as lounging in a hot sauna or taking a cold plunge, claim to increase lifespan, but how effective are they?</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2885%29_0.jpg?itok=SOXX6QUd" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2885%29_0.jpg?itok=SOXX6QUd"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d710470a-570b-445a-abeb-2c5ef1b7f7be" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2885%29_0.jpg?itok=SOXX6QUd" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Growing research points to a different answer, suggesting that a few simple, consistent lifestyle habits can be far more effective at boosting longevity and well-being.</p>

<h2>Avoid Smoking, Drugs, and Drinking Excessive Alcohol</h2>

<p>Referring to a 2024 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38065710/">study</a> examining nearly 720,000 U.S. veterans ages 40 to 99, Dr. Damon Noto, a rehabilitation medicine specialist, stated on the Epoch TV show Vital Signs that among eight lifestyle factors found to influence a person’s lifespan by more than 10 years, the most significant are whether a person has smoked, had an opioid use disorder, and their level of physical activity.</p>

<h2>Eat Healthy and Stay Active</h2>

<p>We know exercise is a healthy habit, but do we consider it life-saving? Noto said the veteran’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38065710/">study</a> shows exercise may add as much as a decade or more to our lives. He also examined the type of physical activity in the study. People in the study often stayed active by engaging in natural movement, such as gardening or participating in sports with their friends. He believes these lifestyle or social activities are especially beneficial because building physical activity into someone’s daily life can help a person stay consistent with moving the body. </p>

<p>Diet can also impact a person’s lifespan. Those living in blue zones tend to eat homegrown and home-cooked foods and avoid overeating. Those who ate highly processed foods and sweets had shorter lifespans than those who followed a nutritious diet, according to the same study.</p>

<h2>Live With Purpose and Be Part of a Community</h2>

<p>Noto highlights a social component of longevity. Research suggests that individuals who have friends and a sense of community tend to live longer than those who are lonely or isolated.</p>

<p>“A lot of these studies have shown that people who have purpose, especially purpose greater than themselves, not only live longer, but they live happier lives and more successful lives,” said Noto. “So purpose is something we found to be extremely important.” </p>

<p>Noto points out that those in blue zones tend to place family and faith as a high priority in their culture.</p>

<h2>Manage Stress</h2>

<p>Noto said that all those with longer lifespans had some way to deal with stress in their regular routines, whether it was socializing with friends, taking walks, praying, or working around the house. </p>

<h2>Be Conscientious </h2>

<p> The <a href="http://www.howardsfriedman.com/longevityproject/">Longevity Project</a>, which began in the 1920s, followed 1,500 Americans with high IQs from childhood to death. Initially, it was thought that because these children were intelligent, they would succeed and do well in life, but that was not the case.</p>

<p>The study showed that the more conscientious a person was, the longer they lived. Character qualities such as discipline, hard work, organization, thoughtful decisions, and a sense of responsibility greatly influences success in life.</p>

<h2>Get Quality Sleep</h2>

<p>Sleep impacts the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38065710/">length</a> of a person’s life. Getting enough REM sleep is crucial to adding years to your life.</p>

<p>Noto recommends getting a sleep-tracking device to ensure you get the proper sleep quality. Those who suffer from chronic anxiety or sleep apnea were shown to have shorter lifespans. However, he also emphasizes the body’s ability to do amazing things, even under stress. He believes that having a sense of purpose helps through times of stress or low sleep, and significantly impacts a person’s health and life. </p>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p data-end="524" data-start="114">A recent <a href="https://www.ladahlaw.com/">study by Ladah Injury & Car Accident Lawyers</a>, a Las Vegas-based personal injury firm, sheds light on which U.S. states have the highest rates of fatal crashes on interstates and freeways. Drawing on crash statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s CDAN portal, the study reviewed data from 2019 to 2023 and ranked states based on the number of fatal freeway crashes per 100,000 residents.</p>

<p data-end="857" data-start="526">Wyoming emerged as the state with the highest rate. With 5.4 fatal freeway crashes per 100,000 people, the state’s rate is nearly three times the national average of 1.9. Between 2019 and 2023, Wyoming averaged 31.6 fatal incidents annually. The worst year was 2023, which saw 42 fatalities, while the lowest number was 21 in 2021.</p>

<p data-end="1090" data-start="859">Coming in second was New Mexico, which recorded 4.3 fatal crashes per 100,000 residents—more than double the national average. The state averaged 91 fatal freeway crashes each year over the five-year period, peaking at 103 in 2023.</p>

<p data-end="1321" data-start="1092">Missouri ranked third with a rate of 3.2 fatal crashes per 100,000 people. The state saw nearly 199 such incidents annually during the study period, with the highest number recorded in 2022 at 227 and the lowest in 2023 with 187.</p>

<p data-end="1551" data-start="1323">Arkansas followed in fourth place, reporting 3.1 fatal freeway crashes per 100,000 people. It averaged just over 95 deadly incidents each year. The highest total came in 2023 with 107 crashes, and the lowest was in 2019 with 69.</p>

<p data-end="1788" data-start="1553">Montana rounded out the top five. The state saw 2.92 fatal crashes per 100,000 residents, well above the national average. Over five years, Montana averaged 32 fatal incidents annually, with 2021 marking its highest year at 47 crashes.</p>

<p data-end="2090" data-start="1790">Other states in the top ten included Mississippi, Alaska, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas—all with crash rates significantly above the national norm. Mississippi, for example, logged 2.89 fatal crashes per 100,000 people, while Texas, despite its much larger population, still had a high rate at 2.6.</p>

<p data-end="2285" data-start="2092">A spokesperson for Ladah Law Firm pointed to several likely causes behind the high fatality rates: long stretches of rural highway, higher speed limits, and reduced visibility in remote areas.</p>

<p data-end="2585" data-start="2287">“States like Wyoming, New Mexico, and Missouri consistently see alarmingly high rates of interstate freeway crashes,” the spokesperson said. “Factors such as long rural stretches, high-speed travel, and limited visibility often create dangerous driving conditions that put lives at risk every day.”</p>

<p data-end="2642" data-start="2587">They also emphasized the human cost behind the numbers.</p>

<p data-end="2775" data-start="2644">“Behind each of these incidents is a family changed forever — victims facing life-altering injuries or grieving unimaginable loss.”</p>

<p data-end="3072" data-start="2777">The law firm called on policymakers to take concrete steps, recommending a stronger highway patrol presence, improved road lighting and signage, and the use of technology to monitor high-risk zones. Public education on speed control and defensive driving was also highlighted as a critical need.</p>

<p data-end="3176" data-start="3074">“It’s time for decisive, proactive measures that prioritize lives over speed,” the spokesperson added.</p>

Title: Unmasking The Real Threat To America's Democracy
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Unmasking The Real Threat To America's Democracy</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/05/unmasking_the_real_threat_to_america_s_democracy.html">Authored by Joseph C. Newtz via American Thinker</a>,</em></p>

<p><strong>America isn't a democracy but a constitutional republic designed to limit majority rule and protect individual rights</strong>. This distortion enables narratives that label dissent as dangerous, especially in portraying Trump as a "threat to democracy" -- a claim pushed by institutions caught spreading falsehoods about him. <strong>What appears as consensus is actually assigned opinion enforced by media and political power, as "conspiracy theories" used to silence dissent are proving to be true.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/white%20house_1.jpg?itok=gj0yRc7n" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/white%20house_1.jpg?itok=gj0yRc7n"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="eb12bd36-89e0-42c5-bda6-02e903ee93ad" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="300" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/white%20house_1.jpg?itok=gj0yRc7n" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></strong></p>

<p>What follows is not just a list of lies -- it’s a pattern of systemic deception that reveals where the real threat lies.</p>

<p><strong>The Concealment of President Biden’s Cognitive Decline: A Betrayal of Voters</strong></p>

<p>For years, concerns about Joe Biden’s mental acuity were dismissed as partisan attacks or “conspiracy theories.” The White House physician declared him fit for office. Staffers claimed he “ran circles around them.” Meanwhile, public appearances were tightly controlled, questions were pre-approved, and scripted answers were passed off as spontaneous.</p>

<p><strong>But in 2024, the dam broke. Biden’s debate performance made his decline undeniable. </strong>Millions had already cast primary ballots for a man clearly unfit to serve -- yet instead of outrage over the scale of the deception, voters watched passively as Kamala Harris stepped in as the de facto candidate.</p>

<p>It was an unconstitutional transfer of candidacy that the media refused to acknowledge. This wasn’t spin -- it was a deliberate, coordinated effort to deceive the American public about who was actually running the country.</p>

<p><strong>All while, the same media complex screamed that Trump was the dictator.</strong></p>

<p>If truth and transparency are foundational to democracy, then this widespread concealment -- and the resulting erosion of informed consent -- should outrage every American who values honest governance.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19: From "Conspiracy" to Consensus</strong></p>

<p>When Trump suggested the virus originated in a lab, the idea was branded "xenophobic" and "debunked." Today, both the CIA and FBI assess a lab leak as probable. This pattern repeated across masks, school closures, natural immunity, and vaccine efficacy.</p>

<p><strong>The CDC quietly redefined "vaccine" to accommodate products that didn't stop transmission,</strong> contradicting officials' earlier claims. Education leaders denied coordinating with teachers unions on prolonged school closures despite evidence proving otherwise, devastating children's mental health and education.</p>

<p>Throughout, Trump was vilified as "anti-science" for questioning narratives that later collapsed -- demonstrating how the "threat to democracy" label silences legitimate dissent.</p>

<p><strong>Border Security: Denial Amid Crisis</strong></p>

<p>While Trump was called xenophobic for demanding border security, his policies effectively curbed illegal crossings without new legislation. In contrast, Biden officials dismantled these effective policies while insisting only Congress could solve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Congress the administration had "operational control" of the border -- while record-breaking illegal entries, overwhelmed facilities, and surging cartel activity told a very different story.</strong></p>

<p>They claimed to be addressing the “root causes” of migration, yet crossings exploded to historic levels. They blamed Trump’s policies as inhumane while ignoring the actual consequences of their own: trafficking increased, fentanyl poured into American communities, and untold lives were lost in the chaos.</p>

<p>Common sense was discarded. Hatred for Trump outweighed concern for national security and human suffering. While illegal immigrants were given free housing, food, and healthcare, American veterans went neglected, seniors faced rising medical costs, and cities buckled under homelessness and resource strain.</p>

<p>These are not partisan talking points -- they are 90/10 issues that should unify Americans regardless of party. But the public was instead gaslit into believing that caring about your own country’s sovereignty is xenophobic or cruel.</p>

<p><strong>The Russia Investigation and Intelligence Abuses</strong></p>

<p>The Trump-Russia narrative -- foundation for claims that Trump threatened democracy -- collapsed when Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy. Later revelations proved more damning: FBI lawyer Clinesmith falsified evidence for a FISA warrant; the Steele dossier contained deliberately false information paid for by Trump's opponents;<strong> exculpatory evidence in the Michael Flynn case was concealed.</strong></p>

<p>The great irony here is staggering: while Trump was accused of being a threat to democratic institutions, those very institutions were being weaponized against him in unprecedented ways. The real undermining of democratic norms came not from Trump, but from those who claimed to be defending democracy against him.</p>

<p><strong>Media Collusion and Information Control</strong></p>

<p>Today's media no longer informs -- it enforces. The New York<em> Post</em> was banned for reporting verified facts about Hunter Biden. Trump's "very fine people" comment was maliciously edited to hide his explicit condemnation of neo-Nazis. His reference to a new technique for sterilizing blood was twisted into a narrative that he told people to "inject bleach."</p>

<p>These aren't mistakes but engineered falsehoods meant to dehumanize political opponents. In a genuine democracy, media checks power; instead, American media has become a propaganda arm defending institutional power while demonizing challengers.</p>

<p><strong>Government Institutions as Political Weapons</strong></p>

<p>Government institutions have been weaponized for political ends while accusing Trump of authoritarianism. Under Obama, the IRS targeted conservative groups. The DoJ labeled concerned parents at school board meetings as potential terrorists. Security clearances and FISA warrants were politically manipulated.</p>

<p><strong>Classified document cases reveal a two-tiered justice system: </strong>aggressive prosecution for Trump versus leniency for Biden and Clinton. January 6th defendants faced harsh treatment compared to 2020 rioters who caused far more destruction.</p>

<p>Federal agencies have colluded with social media to suppress dissent -- raising serious First Amendment concerns. The January 6th Committee's selective editing of evidence and exclusion of exculpatory information about Trump exemplifies how "defending democracy" shields undemocratic behavior.</p>

<p><strong>The Inversion of Reality: Who Truly Threatens Democracy?</strong></p>

<p>Logic dictates a simple conclusion: if nearly every major anti-Trump narrative -- from Russian collusion to COVID origins to Biden’s cognitive health -- has collapsed under scrutiny, what basis remains for believing Trump threatens democracy?</p>

<p>The aftermath is equally clear: if the institutions aligned against him -- intelligence agencies, media conglomerates, and political operatives -- have repeatedly misled the public, their credibility to define “danger” is null. The louder they sound the alarm, the more they reveal about themselves: suppressing information, weaponizing government agencies, manipulating elections, and discarding due process when politically convenient.</p>

<p>And yet, <strong>instead of acknowledging the obvious, many Americans now defend manufactured narratives that make intelligent people sound irrational</strong>. Reasonable citizens abandon common sense -- not because the facts changed, but because the media relentlessly promulgates assigned opinions that demand emotional loyalty over objective thought. Issues that should unite 90% of the public -- like stopping child trafficking, securing borders, or caring for veterans -- become polarizing, not on principle, but because they’re associated with the “wrong” political figure.</p>

<p><strong>Restoring Sanity, Reclaiming Sovereignty</strong></p>

<p>Democracy cannot function without informed citizens. And citizens cannot be informed when they are being systematically lied to -- by government agencies, media platforms, and political leaders who view the truth as a threat to power.</p>

<p>The real crisis in America isn’t Donald Trump. It’s the normalization of institutional lying, the abandonment of due process, and the transformation of journalism into narrative enforcement.</p>

<p>Until we reject assigned opinions and return to objective truth and transparency, we will remain ruled not by reason, but by illusion. Meanwhile, those who shout loudest about “threats to democracy” conceal their actions in shadows -- while figures like Trump operate in full view. If this inversion continues, “government by the people” will be reduced to a hollow phrase -- masking a system of manipulation, not representation.</p>

<p><strong>The time has come for Americans across the political spectrum to acknowledge the pattern of deception and demand better. </strong>Our constitutional republic depends on it.</p>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders as early as Friday <strong>to boost the nuclear energy industry</strong> <strong>by streamlining reactor approvals and reinforcing fuel supply chains, </strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-sign-orders-boost-nuclear-power-soon-friday-sources-say-2025-05-22/">Reuters reported</a> on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p><em>Four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the forthcoming orders aim to simplify the regulatory process for approving new nuclear reactors and to strengthen nuclear fuel supply chains amid mounting concerns over U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers.</em></p>

<p>The news sent nuclear stocks soaring in the after hours session, with names like NuScale and Oklo up 13% and 17%, respectively. </p>

<p>As we <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nuclear-names-oklo-and-nuscale-move-forward-smr-permitting-plans">noted less than a week ago</a>, both names are moving forward with SMR permitting and plans. Sam Altman-backed Oklo says it is navigating what CEO Jacob DeWitte calls “good uncertainty” as potential Trump administration executive orders could accelerate Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing, expand military and Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear roles, and boost U.S. nuclear fuel supply chains, according to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/oklo-trump-nuclear-permitting-reactor-regulatory/748357/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202025-05-16%20Utility%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:73241%5D&utm_term=Utility%20Dive">UtilityDive</a>.</p>

<p>On Oklo’s Q1 2025 earnings call, DeWitte confirmed the company is engaged in a “pre-application readiness assessment” with the NRC, aiming to smooth its formal license submission for a newly upsized 75-MW reactor design in Q4 2025. The company still targets late 2027 or early 2028 for first power production at its Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site.</p>

<p>DeWitte noted the recent departure of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as Oklo board chair <strong>removes a potential conflict of interest should OpenAI become a future power customer</strong>. Oklo already holds about 14 GW in nonbinding agreements with data centers and industrial operators.</p>

<p>The White House is weighing four nuclear-related executive orders, including directives to overhaul NRC licensing with an 18-month deadline for new applications, reconsider radiation exposure limits, and authorize military and DOE property for reactor deployments—potentially bypassing standard NRC approvals.</p>

<p>These efforts aim to boost U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up from about 100 GW today. While the NRC is already implementing changes from last year’s ADVANCE Act, further reforms could shorten Oklo’s expected 24- to 30-month licensing timeline.</p>

It’s developing nuclear fuel fabrication facilities capable of reusing spent fuel that would otherwise sit in long-term storage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/zerohedge/status/1925682323430809816">as we noted on X this evening</a>, OKLO is now up 9x since Jim Cramer said "I can't even look at it" back in October 2024. </p>

<p><strong>The U.S. Supreme Court on May 20 reinstated a Maine state lawmaker’s speaking and voting privileges</strong> that had been suspended over her criticism of males participating in girls’ high school sports.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2873%29_0.jpg?itok=Ab17ihZV" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2873%29_0.jpg?itok=Ab17ihZV"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3af97005-d595-401d-8255-f23cc7d8c8d3" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2873%29_0.jpg?itok=Ab17ihZV" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Maine State Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn), speaks with a colleague at the State House in Augusta on Feb. 14, 2023. Robert F. Bukaty/AP File</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p><strong>In March</strong>, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives barred Maine Rep. Laurel Libby, a Republican,<strong> from speaking or voting on the House floor until she recanted her views on Maine’s policy allowing transgender participation in school sports</strong>, according to the lawmaker’s application filed with the court.</p>

<p>On May 20, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1051_h3ci.pdf">granted</a> Libby’s request for an injunction blocking the House policy as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit considers the case. The unsigned order did not provide reasons for the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Justice Sonia Sotomayor indicated she would deny the application. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson filed a dissent from the granting of the application.</strong></p>

<p>A federal district court previously denied Libby’s application for a preliminary injunction, finding legislative immunity prevented the court from acting because the speaker’s “sanction” was a “legislative act” and the disenfranchisement of the voters in Libby’s legislative district was not so “extraordinary” as to override immunity.</p>

<p>Libby appealed to the First Circuit, which also declined to block the House policy.</p>

<p>In her April 28 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1051/357522/20250428093707178_Libby%20v%20Fecteau%20Emergency%20Application.pdf">application</a> to the Supreme Court, Libby challenged the speaker’s decision to suspend her privileges as a lawmaker.</p>

<p>“<strong>The verbal censure (unwise as it may be) is not what Applicants challenge here. It’s what happened next.</strong></p>

<p>“The Speaker declared Libby was barred from speaking or voting until she recants her view. This means her thousands of constituents in Maine House District 90 are now without a voice or vote for every bill coming to the House floor for the rest of her elected term, which runs through 2026.</p>

<p>“The ongoing and indefinite denial of Libby’s voting rights is unprecedented,” the application said, adding that the U.S. House of Representatives found long ago that the Constitution forbids that chamber from preventing one of its members from voting.</p>

<p>“The member’s vote is not her own; it belongs to her district. And depriving an entire district of representation is no more constitutional than excluding that district from a redistricting plan in the first place. … The same rules apply in Maine.”</p>

<p><strong>On May 8, Maine’s House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, filed a brief urging the Supreme Court not to take up the case.</strong></p>

<p>The brief said that on Feb. 17, Libby “targeted” a high school student who had competed in an event “because that student is transgender,” and identified that student by name. The post, written on her official Facebook account, “quickly went viral,” according to the brief.</p>

<p>Fecteau said he saw the post and “was immediately concerned about the student’s safety and welfare” and sent a letter to Libby, urging her to delete the post. Libby declined.</p>

<p>The Maine House passed a resolution with a vote of 75 to 70, requiring Libby to “accept full responsibility for the incident and publicly apologize to the House and to the people and the State of Maine,” the brief said.</p>

<p>“<strong>Like other censures of Maine House members, the censure resolution required Rep. Libby to apologize for her conduct—not recant her views.</strong>”</p>

<p>Libby declined to apologize, the brief noted. Fecteau determined that Libby had violated House rules and ruled she could not participate in floor debates and floor votes until she apologized.</p>

<p>The speaker said that Libby “retains all other legislative privileges and continues to enjoy considerable means to advance and oppose legislation and otherwise represent her constituents,” despite those restrictions.</p>

<p>In her dissent, Justice Jackson wrote that Libby’s application isn’t an emergency and fails to meet the “high bar” imposed by the federal All Writs Act, which gives the Supreme Court authority to issue injunctions. She said that the First Circuit is “moving quickly to evaluate the legal issues this case presents,” and oral argument is scheduled for the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Libby has failed to show that her right to the relief she requested is “indisputably clear,” Jackson wrote, citing a legal precedent.</p>

<p><strong>This leaves “many difficult questions,” such as whether there are limits to state legislatures’ power to bind lawmakers to ethics rules, and whether federal courts may determine if those rules are improper, Jackson wrote.</strong></p>

<p>For example, “Does it violate a representative’s First Amendment rights to be subject to sanction under such rules, and does it make a difference what the sanction is?”</p>

<p>“This Court has neither addressed nor answered most of these questions,” Jackson wrote.</p>

Title: A Look At The New Surgeon General
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">A Look At The New Surgeon General</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/05/a_look_at_the_new_surgeon_general.html">Authored by Jeffrey Folks via American Thinker</a>,</em></p>

<p><strong>Not long ago, U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. defended Trump’s nomination of Casey Means as surgeon general. </strong> In his nomination remarks, Trump wrote that Means would “work closely” with Kennedy “to ensure a successful implementation of our Agenda in order to reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health, in the future, for ALL Americans.”</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/AA1ElZKv.img_92.jpg?itok=vdEns8CW" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/AA1ElZKv.img_92.jpg?itok=vdEns8CW"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0edb5d6e-4f5e-447a-bfc7-d4aa209238fa" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/AA1ElZKv.img_92.jpg?itok=vdEns8CW" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p><strong>Trained as a head and neck surgeon, Casey Means abandoned her career in surgery to become a prominent “wellness” influencer.</strong>  Like RFK Jr., Means promotes preventive and alternative medicine that might result in fewer surgeries and other invasive treatments.  She practices “functional medicine” and is not board certified in a medical specialty.  No wonder her nomination has been attacked by professional groups associated with surgeons and other members of the medical establishment.</p>

<p>Means has promoted what some see as “controversial” ideas, such as removing ultra-processed foods in school lunches and replacing them with unprocessed foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables.  This might seem like common sense, but it threatens a food industry that is focused on processed meat, dairy, and other foods and that employs powerful lobbies to maintain sales.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/05/glucose%20%22as%20a%20molecule%20has%20caused%20more%20destruction%20of%20the%20human%20mind%20and%20body%20than%20any%20other%20substance%20in%20human%20history.%22">her view</a> that <strong>glucose “as a molecule has caused more destruction of the human mind and body than any other substance in human history.”</strong>  Like RFK Jr., Means supports food warnings and possibly outright bans on high-sugar foods.</p>

<p>During the Sep. 27, 2024, Roundtable Discussion of Children’s Health: A Second Opinion, Means joined Sen. Ron Johnson, RFK Jr., and a dozen experts in a discussion of preventive options for children’s health.  At the roundtable, Dr. Means stated that “if the current trends continue ... at best, we’re going to face profound societal instability and decreased American competitiveness, and at worst, we’re going to be looking at a genocidal level health collapse.”</p>

<p>A full<a href="https://rumble.com/v5fy7bv-american-health-and-nutrition-a-second-opinion.html?start=1852"> four-hour video </a>of the roundtable is available online and is well worth watching for what it says about America’s health care crisis and about the views of RFK Jr. and Casey Means.  Several panelists referred to the “corruption” and economic self-interest of food and health care systems that, in their opinion, are making Americans chronically ill.  As Means stated, every segment of the current “health care” system “makes more money when we are sick.”  It is not a matter of degree, one panelist stated, but of “black and white ... good and evil.”  According RFK Jr., if a foreign country did these things to us — the poisoning of our food supply and corruption of our health care system — “it would be considered an act of war.”</p>

<p><strong>A crucial point is that President Trump himself stands behind, and in fact set in motion via his appointment of RFK Jr., Means and others in this effort to transform America’s health</strong>.  More than anyone, it is Trump who is spearheading the effort to transform health care and diet, as well as to lower the cost of prescription drugs and other medical costs.  One recalls that in his first term, Trump passed the “Right to Try” legislation that has opened ongoing clinical trials to those willing to pay for them.</p>

<p>Many persons associated with the medical establishment might label Means and RFK Jr. as radicals because of their intention to fundamentally transform American health.  This transformation involves many elements, but at its heart, it is a change of approach among physicians away from treating symptoms to promoting wellness.  Along with this, there would be major changes in diet and exercise.</p>

<p>Whether Kennedy and Means are radicals is, of course, a matter of opinion. <strong> But no one can deny that, despite spending more per capita than any other country in the world, the U.S. has one of the highest levels of chronic and acute disease</strong>.  This is a problem that must be addressed either by government or by individual choice.</p>

<p>The rate of adult obesity in the U.S. stands at 40% and it is rising.  Three fourths of U.S. adults have at least one serious marker of disease — high blood sugar, high blood pressure, obesity or overweight, heart disease, arthritis, and others.  We are not a well nation.  Just recently I sat outside a local grocery for 30 minutes (waiting on my wife) and observed that a majority of shoppers coming out, their carts piled with Mothers’ Day foods and presents, were either overweight or obese.  This is not natural, and it is not the way most of us want it to be.  But as many commentators have written, we live in an unhealthy environment that deliberately promotes unhealthy choices.</p>

<p>This is not to say that individual choice plays no role in our predicament.  Pizza is the most popular food in America, and this choice is not forced on us.  Hamburgers, often loaded with cheese and extra meat patties, are second — again, not because of a conspiracy on the part of the medical establishment, but because they are quick, filling, and tasty.  To really change American health, it would be necessary to shift eating patterns from pizza and burgers.  Only three percent of Americans consistently eat whole plant-based foods at present.</p>

<p><strong>Many critics believe that these changes are too extreme and that the chances of bringing them about are slim.</strong>  But health advocates have pointed out that as late as the 1980s, a majority of Americans still smoked on a regular basis, and now that figure stands at 14%.  Change in health habits is possible if driven by public education and social and economic pressure.  The price of a pack of cigarettes has risen from about 30 cents in 1960 to six dollars today, a result mostly of higher taxation and litigation designed to restrict consumption.  A similar program of education and taxation could be applied to sugary foods and drinks.</p>

<p>“Transformation” is difficult to achieve, as I fear Kennedy and Means will find out.  But incremental changes are possible, and I believe they should be implemented.  As a conservative, I believe that healthy choices are a matter of individual choice, but it is a fact that government policy toward reducing smoking has saved an estimated 8 million lives, 3.5 million of them from lung cancer.  Even minor changes to food and medical systems will, I believe, save an equal number of lives.  It is right to ban artificial food dyes.  It is right to educate the public about the harm of excessive sugar.  It is right to promote consumption of more natural foods.</p>

<p>As with the appointment of RFK Jr., <strong>Trump’s nomination of Casey Means as U.S. surgeon general is a shot across the bow of America’s health care system and the food and drink industry.</strong>  Trump campaigned on making America “healthy again.”  There <em>is </em>a crisis, and every American is affected in some way — if not directly by disease, then by the burden of health care spending.  Trump’s appointment of RFK Jr. and his nomination of Casey Means are steps in the right direction.</p>

Title: North Carolina Communities Rising From The Ruins Of Hurricane Helene

<p>CHIMNEY ROCK, N.C.—<strong>North Carolina officials estimate that it will take many years, many hands, and up to $60 billion to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in late September 2024.</strong></p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2874%29_0.jpg?itok=k0n1FJ3M" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2874%29_0.jpg?itok=k0n1FJ3M"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="30c0b4da-0c06-49c3-a9c4-469283fb37a8" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2874%29_0.jpg?itok=k0n1FJ3M" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Allan Stein/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>In the historic village of Chimney Rock, located in the western part of the state, a dedicated army of volunteers has been providing much-needed assistance to the recovery effort at no cost.</p>

<p>“<strong>It hasn’t required much funding,</strong>” Shane Zoccole, founder and director of the South Carolina-based disaster relief nonprofit Spokes of Hope, said.</p>

<p>Zoccole told The Epoch Times that the recovery effort in Chimney Rock is primarily driven by volunteers.</p>

<p>“<strong>Chimney Rock is essential to the valley—it’s the commerce of this area,“ he said. ”We felt led to help the businesses, to help the people here, and to get this town to stay on the map instead of going off the map.</strong>”</p>

<p>Since October 2024, Zoccole has led more than 2,000 volunteers from various nonprofits willing to help without compensation.</p>

<p>Among the volunteers are hundreds of Amish and Mennonite people from Ohio and Pennsylvania who are ready to go the distance, he said.</p>

<p>“<strong>We eat breakfast by 8 a.m., work orders go out, we’re working by 8:30, and then we work until just about 6 p.m., when dinner is served</strong>,” Zoccole said.</p>

<p>“It’s been all the moving parts connecting with local business owners and volunteers across the nation.”</p>

<p>He said it has been a collaborative effort since the hurricane made a lasting impact on the landscape eight months ago.</p>

<p>Zoccole founded Spokes of Hope in 2018 after Hurricane Florence caused nine deaths and resulted in $2 <a href="https://apnews.com/weather-general-news-a19e36ba2b2c49949d3e247cf7ea9896">billion</a> in damages across South Carolina.</p>

<p>However, that was dwarfed by the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene, he said.</p>

<p><strong>Much of Chimney Rock, a village in western North Carolina’s Hickory Nut Gorge on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was either damaged, destroyed, or buried under several feet of mud.</strong></p>

<p>The bridge over the Rocky Broad River, leading to the state park near the village, collapsed in the rising floodwaters, which reached a height of 20 feet.</p>

<p>The ferocious wind, powerful currents, and heavy rain swept away several businesses along the river. All that remained were the concrete foundations.</p>

<p>Near the Bat Cave residential area, a ticket booth remained on its side, while the stately homes further upriver lay in ruins or exhibited heavy damage. Many homes that survived the torrent were no longer safe for habitation.</p>

<p>Confronted with such devastation, Zoccole’s initial reaction was that using a bulldozer to clear the wreckage would be a more effective solution than implementing a reconstruction plan for the village.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Zoccole and his relief volunteers refused to give up on the community.</p>

<p>“<strong>We have to go to the finish</strong>,” he said.</p>

<p>“<strong>If we don’t finish something that we’ve started, then we’ve [basically] told these people we’re only here part-time for you. We’re only here to help you a little bit.</strong>”</p>

<p>Members of the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division arrived in early October 2024, armed with buckets and shovels to clear the knee-deep mud and allow other volunteers to begin repairs.</p>

<p>By early May, volunteers had removed tons of silt and debris from the water-damaged shops. They rebuilt several of them to code using donated and repurposed materials and equipment.</p>

<p>Although many shops remain closed for repairs, Chimney Rock Village no longer bears the worst scars from the hurricane.</p>

<p>Zoccole noted that considerable work remains, as the village business center plans to reopen this summer, possibly in June.</p>

<p>“Our success is in our unity. We’ve been able to pull together ahead of schedule,” he said.</p>

<h2>A Storm Like No Other</h2>

<p>Chimney Rock Village, located in Rutherford County, has a rural population of about 140 residents. It is one of the 39 counties in North Carolina designated as a critical disaster area following Hurricane Helene.</p>

<p>The hurricane struck Florida with winds of 140 mph on Sept. 26, 2024, before moving into North Carolina the next morning and causing severe rain, flooding, and deadly landslides across much of the western third of the state.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2877%29_0.jpg?itok=CcP_83N1" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2877%29_0.jpg?itok=CcP_83N1"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="11635c14-5748-4b65-bed8-588de1c29796" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2877%29_0.jpg?itok=CcP_83N1" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>A welcome sign greets visitors to Chimney Rock Village, N.C., on May 6, 2025.

<p>In certain regions, rainfall accumulation reached as much as 30 inches. The storm caused damage to, or destroyed, more than 73,000 homes, roads, and bridges across 6,900 sites, including the heavily trafficked Interstate 40.</p>

<p>The storm claimed more than 100 lives across the state and directly caused 176 deaths across the southeastern region, with seven residents still unaccounted for in North Carolina, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092024_Helene.pdf">according</a> to federal government data.</p>

<p>One resident of Chimney Rock Village lost her life during the storm, which was deemed the worst since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.osbm.nc.gov/hurricane-helene-dna/open">revised</a> North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management assessment, the estimated multi-year recovery costs are nearly $60 billion.</p>

<p>The report estimates the storm’s total economic impact at more than $16 billion, which includes $3 billion in direct damages to businesses, and more than $12 billion in lost revenue, excluding wages and income.</p>

<p><strong>Then-North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper requested $3.9 billion from the General Assembly to support struggling communities. Of this total, $1.2 billion has already been allocated, with an additional $225 million set aside in reserve.</strong></p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated $850 million for this initiative, which includes the deployment of 8,500 personnel for emergency response.</p>

<h2>‘Nothing but Mud’</h2>

<p>Erica Stafford, 40, is the head chef and kitchen manager at Lured Market and Grill near Lake Lure and Chimney Rock.</p>

<p>She said she has witnessed powerful storms and the death and economic havoc they leave behind, but Helene seemed to be far worse.</p>

<p>“Nobody expected it to be what it was,” Stafford said. “Even living here, I thought, ‘Well, there’ll be some flooding. We’re going to have a tree down. We’re going to be out of power.’ Nobody expected the amount of damage done.</p>

<p>“It was such a mess. I got down here, and it was nothing but mud.”</p>

<p><strong>Who doesn’t look forward to retirement?</strong> After all, it’s a much-deserved break after decades of work. During this time, you can <a href="https://due.com/money-saving-travel-tips-for-retirees/">travel</a>, enjoy <a href="https://due.com/find-your-passion-50-hobbies-to-enrich-your-retirement/">hobbies</a>, and spend quality time with loved ones. <strong>Unfortunately, scammers tend to strike during this time as well.</strong> Due to their savings, home ownership, and perhaps less familiarity with digital threats, retirees are prime targets for financial fraud.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2884%29_0.jpg?itok=5wlSEjF-" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2884%29_0.jpg?itok=5wlSEjF-"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9e6c3c6f-2402-468a-933a-fe2a9cae1ca4" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2884%29_0.jpg?itok=5wlSEjF-" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>TetianaKtv/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>In 2023 alone, Americans over the age of 60 lost more than <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/elder-fraud-in-focus">$3.4 billion to scams</a>. Furthermore, despite fraud being underreported, older victims who file complaints often report higher losses than younger victims. Specifically, scams resulted in <a href="https://www.tiaa.org/public/institute/publication/2025/safeguarding-retirement-in-the-age-of-scams#:~:text=Key%20Insights,those%20ages%2020%20to%2059.">$1,450 for those 80 or older</a>, compared with less than $500 for those 20 to 59.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, this should be a wake-up call. The good news? Your best defense is awareness. This post will explain how to protect yourself and your financial future from common retirement scams.</p>

<h2><strong>Understanding the Predator’s Mindset: Why Retirees Are Targeted</strong></h2>

<p>To understand the underlying reasons why older adults are often the targets of common scams, it is imperative to understand the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Accumulated wealth.</strong> Often, retirees have substantial assets like retirement accounts, pensions, and home equity, making them attractive targets for financial gain.</li>
	<li><strong>Lower technological familiarity. </strong>Many retirees may not be familiar with sophisticated online threats, like phishing emails, website spoofing, and other forms of fraud, making them more susceptible to deception.</li>
	<li><strong>A more trusting nature.</strong> Older adults may have grown up when trust was more readily given. Consequently, they may be less inclined to question seemingly authoritative figures or strangers who seem overly friendly.</li>
	<li><strong>Social isolation and loneliness.</strong> It is common for scammers to prey on feelings of loneliness and isolation, especially in those who have lost their spouses or have limited social interaction. Ultimately, they exploit their victims by cultivating false friendships or romantic relationships.</li>
</ul><p>Recognizing these inherent risk factors is crucial to enhancing retirees’ and their loved ones’ protection from financial abuse.</p>

<h2><strong>Unmasking the Deception: Common Retirement Scams and Their Tactics</strong></h2>

<p>Now, let’s examine some of the most common scams targeting retirees, dissecting how they work and the telltale signs to watch out for.</p>

<h3><strong>Imposter Scams: Authority </strong><strong>Scams </strong><strong>(IRS, Medicare, or Social Security)</strong></h3>

<p>During this scam, unsolicited calls will be received from individuals who impersonate official government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Medicare, or Social Security Administration. Typically, scammers claim you owe back taxes, have problems with your Medicare coverage, or are about to lose your Social Security benefits. Often, they threaten arrest, legal action, or immediate suspension of benefits if you do not act immediately.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags. </strong>A red flag might include threats of immediate arrest, demands for payment through unconventional and untraceable methods like gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency, and a false sense of urgency.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself.</strong> No legitimate government agency will demand payment over the phone, especially in unconventional ways. When you receive such a call, call the agency directly. Never provide your Social Security or Medicare number if you did not initiate the call.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Tech Support Scams: The Digital Distress Call</strong></h3>

<p>It typically starts with a pop-up message that says, “Warning! Your computer has been infected! Call this number right away!” You may also receive an unsolicited call from someone pretending to represent a well-known tech company such as Microsoft or Apple, offering to “remotely fix” a problem you do not have.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags.</strong> Unexpected popups that ask you to call a specific number, unsolicited phone calls about alleged computer problems, and requests for remote access to your computer.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself.</strong> If you receive an unsolicited tech support offer, do not trust it. In case of a pop-up that appears suspicious, do not call the number displayed. Also, you should never grant remote access to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly. Further, ensure you have reputable antivirus software installed and that your operating system and applications are up-to-date. Whenever you need technical assistance, contact a trusted and verified company yourself.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>The Grandparent Scam: Exploiting Familial Love</strong></h3>

<p>The grandparent scam manipulates older adults by exploiting their emotional bonds through urgency and fear. Typically, this begins with a vague call—“Hi Grandma, do you know who this is?”—inviting the grandparent to guess. When a name is offered, the scammer pretends to be the grandchild in crisis, asking for money to pay for car trouble, rent, medical expenses, or bail.</p>

<p>The scammer often asks the grandparent not to tell anyone else, adding emotional pressure. In more elaborate schemes, a second caller calls pretending to be an authority figure, like a police officer or doctor. Due to AI, scammers can now clone authentic voices to make their impersonations more convincing.</p>

<p>Usually, they request payment through untraceable methods like wire transfers or gift cards. Rarely but alarmingly, scammers send couriers to collect cash.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags</strong><strong>.</strong> A stranger pretending to be a grandchild, urgent requests for money, secrecy, muffled or off-sounding voices, and demands for untraceable payments.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself</strong><strong>.</strong> When telling a story to your grandchild or a family member, you should always pause and verify the story. You should never send money to someone until you have verified their identity. Never trust anyone who insists on secrecy or a fast turnaround.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Romance Scams: The Illusion of Love and Connection</strong></h3>

<p>Typically, this scam is perpetrated online, via dating websites or social media. During the scam, the scammer establishes a romantic relationship with the victim, showering them with affection and declarations of love. When they have gained the victim’s trust and established an emotional connection, they will inevitably ask for money, often claiming a sudden medical crisis, a promising but urgent business investment, or a plane ticket to a destination.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags.</strong> Oftentimes, the individual avoids meeting in person or engaging in video calls, and their stories often contain inconsistencies or change frequently.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself.</strong> Whenever you interact with individuals online, exercise extreme caution. Be wary of people who express their feelings too quickly. Never send them money or share your financial information if you haven’t met the person in person. If unsure, talk to a trusted friend or family member who can provide an objective perspective on the relationship. You can also check their profile pictures for stolen identity by performing a reverse image search.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Investment and Retirement Account Scams: The Siren Song of Guaranteed Riches</strong></h3>

<p>These schemes involve scammers posing as legitimate financial advisors or brokers and offering unrealistically high returns. Sometimes, investors might be pushed to make quick decisions or invest in obscure or unregistered securities.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags.</strong> Frequently use high-pressure sales tactics, promise high profits with no associated risk, lack proper documentation or registration, and refuse to provide verified credentials.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself.</strong> Before entrusting your money to any financial advisor or broker, thoroughly research. You can verify their credentials and disciplinary history through FINRA’s BrokerCheck or the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website. Also, do not rush into investing decisions based on pressure or unrealistic promises. Never give access to your account to anyone you do not know well and do not trust implicitly.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Financial Services Scam: The Illusion of Legitimacy</strong></h3>

<p>A financial services scam mimics the behavior of a genuine financial institution, such as a bank or loan company. It is common for fraudsters to use phone calls, texts, or emails that appear and sound authentic. It is possible for them to claim your account was compromised or to offer fake services such as better loan rates. You might even be threatened with arrest if you do not pay your medical bills.</p>

<p>Scammers can appear convincingly legitimate with spoofed caller IDs and near-identical email addresses. Under the guise of security or assistance, they will ask you for sensitive information, such as passwords, Social Security numbers, or payment via peer-to-peer (P2P) apps.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags</strong><strong>.</strong> There will be unexpected communication about account issues or offers, pressure to act quickly, requests for sensitive data, suspicious links, and payment demands via P2P apps.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself</strong><strong>.</strong> Personal or financial information shouldn’t be shared unless you initiated contact via a verified phone number or website. You should also avoid clicking links or opening attachments from unknown senders. Whenever in doubt, hang up and call your bank or lender directly.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Sweepstakes and Lottery Scams: The Phantom Prize</strong></h3>

<p>Scammers typically call, email, or mail you unexpectedly, claiming to have won a prize you didn’t even enter in a sweepstakes or lottery. You are, however, instructed to pay upfront fees or taxes to claim your supposed winnings.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags.</strong> There are no records of you entering the contest or lottery; you are asked to wire money, purchase gift cards, or make other upfront payments to claim your prize, and there is no legitimate verification that you won.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself.</strong> Winners of legitimate sweepstakes and lotteries will never have to pay upfront fees or taxes to claim their prizes. If a prize sounds too good to be true, it is likely a scam. As such, you should never send money or provide financial information to claim a prize.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Business Impostor Scams: Exploiting Trust in Familiar Names</strong></h3>

<p>An imposter scam targets older adults by posing as a well-known company or charity representative. Scammers use fake caller IDs, emails, or websites to appear authentic. Their goal? Pretending to resolve an issue or confirm a transaction to steal money or information.</p>

<p>They might claim that your account is locked, your payment is late, or you won a prize. Some of these sites ask for gift cards or ask for sensitive information so that you can “verify” your identity. People often comply without suspicion because they impersonate familiar names like Amazon, PayPal, local utilities, or national charities.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Red flags</strong><strong>.</strong> You may receive unsolicited messages from companies or charities, urgent demands for payment or donations, gift card payments, and personal information requests.</li>
	<li><strong>How to protect yourself</strong><strong>.</strong> Never trust a familiar name without verifying it independently. For confirmation, call the company’s official number or visit their official website. If you receive an unexpected or high-pressure communication, do not give out any personal information or send money, no matter how convincing it may seem.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Proactive Measures: Smart Ways to Protect Yourself and Your Money</strong></h2>

<p>Besides recognizing red flags of specific scams, you can also enhance your security by adopting these proactive habits:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Guard your personal information.</strong> Shred any documents containing sensitive data before discarding them. Unless you initiated the contact and are certain of the recipient’s legitimacy, you should never share your Social Security number, bank account details, credit card information, or passwords.</li>
	<li><strong>Employ strong passwords and two-factor authentication.</strong> Keep your online accounts secure by using unique, complex passwords. If two-factor authentication is available, enable it, as it adds another layer of security beyond your password. If you have many passwords to manage, consider using a reputable password manager.</li>
	<li><strong>Monitor your accounts diligently.</strong> Check your bank and credit card statements carefully each month for unauthorized transactions. If you notice unusual transactions or withdrawals, set up account alerts through your financial institution. For identity theft protection, obtain and review your credit report annually with AnnualCreditReport.com.</li>
	<li><strong>Communicate openly with trusted individuals.</strong> If you notice any suspicious activity, feel free to discuss financial matters with trusted family members, friends, or your financial advisor. A second opinion can often help identify scams. When considering a significant financial decision, talk to a trusted friend or family member about it thoroughly.</li>
	<li><strong>Stay informed and educated.</strong> Follow updates from reputable organizations like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to stay up-to-date on scam trends and fraud prevention tips. Participate in local seminars or webinars to increase your knowledge of elder fraud protection. Whenever you doubt the legitimacy of something, always ask questions and verify the information.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Taking Action: What to Do if You’ve Been Targeted by a Scam</strong></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, even the most vigilant individuals can fall victim to sophisticated scams. If you believe you have been targeted or have fallen for a scam, remember that you are not alone and that swift action is imperative.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Cease all communication.</strong> You should immediately cease all communication with the suspected scammer. Do not answer any further calls, messages, or emails.</li>
	<li><strong>Report the incident.</strong> The following authorities should be notified: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC): <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3):<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">www.ic3.gov</a>, and the <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/helpline/">AARP Fraud Watch Helpline: 877-908-3360</a>. You can also contact your local police department, especially if you have suffered financial loss.</li>
	<li><strong>Contact your financial institutions.</strong> You should immediately freeze your bank account or credit card if you provided any details to the scammer.</li>
	<li><strong>Monitor your credit.</strong> To help prevent further identity theft, place a fraud alert or a credit freeze on your credit report.</li>
	<li><strong>Talk about your experience.</strong> In addition to providing emotional support, telling others about your scam experience can prevent others from falling prey to similar scams and reduce the stigma associated with scam victims.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>

<p>In retirement, you should feel peaceful and fulfilled, not stressed and concerned about your finances. Being vigilant, informed, and open to conversations about money will help you protect yourself from ever-evolving scams.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that legitimate organizations will never pressure you to make quick decisions, ask for sensitive information over the phone, or demand payment in untraceable forms like gift cards. If you’re unsure, pause, verify, and speak up.</p>

<p>It’s worth protecting because you’ve worked hard for your financial security.</p>

<p><strong>An Arizona grand jury has indicted 22 individuals and entities linked to a massive Medicaid fraud scheme involving sober living homes.</strong></p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2872%29_0.jpg?itok=bN-Nx4Dq" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2872%29_0.jpg?itok=bN-Nx4Dq"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="96bd8bef-dc83-462a-9fb0-f49f562ef661" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="333" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2872%29_0.jpg?itok=bN-Nx4Dq" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>The Arizona and American flags blow in the wind in Terra Vista, Ariz., on March 5, 2025. John Fredricks/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p><strong>The charges include money laundering, theft, conspiracy, fraudulent schemes, patient referral fraud, and forgery, </strong>Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-22-new-indictments-sober-living-home-fraud-case">announced</a> Tuesday.</p>

<p>These indictments are part of an ongoing investigation into a <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/doj-charges-nearly-200-people-in-2-7-billion-health-care-fraud-crackdown-5676509">$2.7 billion fraud</a> that exploited Arizona’s health care system, particularly targeting Native Americans seeking treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/Happy%20House%20Behavioral%20Health%20LLC%20Indictment_Redacted%2005.19.25%20%281%29.pdf">charge document</a>, the 20 individuals indicted are associated with a church and a mental health organization called Happy House Behavioral Health. <strong>Prosecutors allege that Happy House was paid over $60 million for services that were either never rendered or only partially completed.</strong> Some of the billing, they say, was for clients who were deceased or incarcerated.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also allege that <strong>sober living facilities referred clients to Happy House, which in turn received funds from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), the state’s Medicaid agency.</strong> Happy House then allegedly paid the referring sober homes for those client placements, an arrangement at the center of the fraudulent scheme charges.</p>

<p>Among the money laundering charges is a $5 million payment that Happy House allegedly made in July 2023 to Hope of Life International Church, which later transferred $2 million to an entity in Rwanda.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing Happy House and Hope of Life International Church could not be immediately reached for comments.</p>

<p><strong>More than 100 individuals and multiple companies have so far been <a href="https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/behavioral-health-fraud-indictments">charged</a></strong> in cases cases tied to Arizona’s sweeping crackdown on Medicaid fraud and unlicensed sober living homes, many of which specifically targeted members of Native American tribes.</p>

<p>Starting around 2019, scammers lured individuals into fraudulent treatment programs by promising food, shelter, and addiction recovery services. Instead, they were placed in sober living homes where operators often allowed or even encouraged continued drug and alcohol use, according to state officials. Victims were often cut off from family contact, and in some cases held against their will, the charges allege.</p>

<p>“<strong>Isolated by these organizations, people had to escape out of windows and jump over fences in the middle of the night just to access a phone to reach the outside world</strong>,” said Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs in 2023, during the announcement of a crackdown that suspended payments to 102 providers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the scammers overbilled the American Indian Health Program, a Medicaid plan for tribal members, for services that were never provided. AHCCCS said between 2019 and 2022, outpatient behavioral health claims surged from $53 million to $668 million.</p>

<p>In response to what Hobbs described as a humanitarian crisis, the state <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-tribal-nation-and-non-profit-recipients-6-million">launched</a> a $6 million grant in November 2024 to support tribal communities harmed by the scam.</p>

<p>In April, Hobbs signed <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/82688">a law</a> tightening oversight of sober living homes. Under the new law, the Arizona Department of Health Services will establish standards for facilities to ensure a drug- and alcohol-free environment and promote recovery. The department will also have authority to suspend or revoke licenses, or fine violators up to $1,000 for each day a violation remains unaddressed.</p>

<p>At a minimum, the law requires the department to conduct annual inspections, track complaints, and report to lawmakers how many led to investigations or enforcement actions.</p>

Title: Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Strips Al Capone-Era Tax On Suppressors
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Strips Al Capone-Era Tax On Suppressors</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Gun rights groups celebrated Thursday morning after the House narrowly passed President Trump's "<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-narrowly-passes-house-215-214-vote">Big, Beautiful Bill</a>" in a 215–214 vote. Organizations like Gun Owners of America praised the legislation for including the Constitutional Hearing Protection Act (CHPA), which eliminates both the federal registration requirement and the $200 tax on firearm suppressors. The provision drew sharp criticism from anti-gunners and leftist media outlets as the bill now heads to the Senate. </p>

<p>"The<strong> House of Representatives passes GOA-backed language 215-214 to ELIMINATE the unconstitutional taxation & registration of suppressors under the NFA</strong>," GOA wrote on X, adding, "<strong>The bill heads to the Senate, where GOA will fight to include protections for short-barreled firearms too</strong>." </p>

Title: What The Biden Health Coverup Reveals About The Political Class
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">What The Biden Health Coverup Reveals About The Political Class</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://mises.org/mises-wire/what-biden-health-coverup-reveals-about-political-class">Authored by Connor O'Keefe via the Mises Institute</a>,</em></p>

<p><strong>Over the weekend, the Biden family announced that former President Joe Biden has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/politics/biden-prostate-cancer.html">diagnosed</a> with stage IV prostate cancer.</strong> The statement said that the cancer was characterized by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10, indicating it is highly aggressive, and that it has already spread to the bone.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/BidenCoverup_Wire_jpg_webp_92.jpg?itok=JU4gkBBN" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/BidenCoverup_Wire_jpg_webp_92.jpg?itok=JU4gkBBN"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cfa23ad1-8a04-404f-a6ba-9e749a8c758c" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="375" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/BidenCoverup_Wire_jpg_webp_92.jpg?itok=JU4gkBBN" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Well-wishes poured in from both the former president’s allies and political opponents as the Bidens reportedly reviewed treatment options.<strong> But it didn’t take long for people to note a few questionable details about the nature and timing of this announcement.</strong></p>

<p>First, it happened to come a little over thirty hours before the release of a highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sin-President-Cover-Up-Disastrous-ebook/dp/B0DXCMSHVL">book</a> by CNN’s Jake Tapper and <em>Axios</em>’s Alex Thompson that detailed Joe Biden’s mental decline while in office and the effort by people around him to cover it up <strong>and deny it was happening at all</strong>. While other books have already come out claiming to tell this story, none have come from journalists as highly respected by the political establishment as Tapper and Thompson.</p>

<p>Also, the day before the announcement,<strong> <em>Axios</em> released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNjkE_tDZts">full recording</a> of Biden’s interview with special counsel Robert Hur,</strong> where the president’s difficulty answering straightforward questions was on full display at the same time his allies in the media were trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kKUye23KBQ">claim</a> he was “as sharp as a tack.”</p>

<p><strong>That convenient timing and speed at which some Biden allies, like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373058221112">David Axelrod</a>, came out and said that talk of the former president’s decline should now be set aside</strong> because of this diagnosis led to some skepticism about the claim that the cancer was discovered only a few days ago.</p>

<p>That <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-cancer-diagnosis-prompts-new-questions-about-his-health-while-office-2025-05-19/">skepticism</a> only grew as doctors began reacting with <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/doctors-raise-questions-about-timing-of-biden-cancer-diagnosis-unbelievable-this-was-missed">disbelief</a> that cancer at this late a stage could have either just developed in the past few months or gone undetected for years while Biden was president. That’s especially true considering that prostate cancer is typically easier to discover early than most other cancers due to <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/psa-fact-sheet">antigens</a> it releases in the blood that can be detected with a simple blood test—a blood test we know both presidents Obama and Trump had <a href="https://news.grabien.com/story/msnbc-s-dr-gupta-bush-obama-and-trump-all-had-this-prostate-test-and-i">taken</a> while they were in office.</p>

<p>It is certainly possible that no physical health problems were covered up during Biden’s presidency, that his cancer was only detected for the first time a few weeks ago, as his office has said.<strong> But many of those most aggressively denying that anything shady is happening with the timing of this announcement will have a much harder time getting the public to believe them </strong>because of the blatant and unsuccessful attempt to censor, hide, and deny Biden’s deteriorating mental state in the lead up to the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The lengths to which establishment politicians and major media figures went to gaslight the American public into dismissing something that was obvious to anyone who was looking should never be forgotten because it exposed the true nature of the political class. They lied, shamelessly, to further their political ambitions.</p>

<p>While that’s far from unusual, rarely are their lies as blatantly and immediately obvious as <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-top-democrats-said-then-now-about-joe-bidens-decline-2073468">saying</a> Biden was sharp and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/biden-age-wall-street-journal-morning-joe-1235959576/">highly engaged</a> behind closed doors and that every video that purported to show otherwise was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/cheap-fake-biden-videos-burst-100000427.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAmD5xX-aXtkm5eGm1zG5jlTdQUDJ1ygaTiaTAIHn8Fm_wdGgoPXdxs5RCRMLJO4HttHkgBThlkLvaAYxFEFWSA0skUeq2B8f43qMeJ3L2dPBKOQp26E14Aa0kFtdF05YU1TrggASorr_ivGzUOtLx3u3g4eC2Z2z1DGDnt6DjrS">fabricated</a> by far-right video editors.</p>

<p><strong>It’s also rare for the establishment’s lies to blow up in their faces as quickly and extensively as this one did at the now famous June 2024 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v-8wJkmwBY">presidential debate</a>.</strong> Once it became obvious that the lie would not hold, virtually the entire anti-Trump political scene flipped on a dime and began parroting concerns that they were mocking people for voicing mere hours before.</p>

<p>The political class is still struggling to run damage control. The most promising strategy—seemingly embodied by Tapper and Thompson’s new book—is to try to pin the blame on a handful of staffers, claiming they hid the truth from media figures like Tapper who then unintentionally <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/media/jake-tapper-slammed-for-rewriting-history-to-cash-in-on-book-covering-bidens-decline/">spread</a> the lie to the rest of the world. But that would be a much easier sell if millions of Americans had not spent years openly talking about the very thing that was apparently being hidden from them. Still, the establishment will throw as many staffers under the bus as they need to avoid admitting they lied. They do not want the takeaway from this episode to be that they need to lie less.</p>

<p>And beyond that,<strong> if the establishment admitted they knowingly supported an increasingly cognitively impaired man, not only to remain in office but to serve an entire second term, it would <a href="https://mises.org/mises-wire/biden-not-running-government-so-who">shatter the illusion</a> that our government is truly run by a president who embodies the wishes of the voting public</strong>, like we learned in elementary school. It would reveal the fact that, as long as they don’t actively speak out against or draw attention to all the ways the political class is ripping the American public off, the person sitting in the Oval Office is essentially irrelevant.</p>

<p>Whether the timing of Biden’s cancer announcement is a particularly disgusting part of the scheme to cover all this up or truly a complete coincidence, the last few days have made it clear that the damage the political class did to its credibility with its attempted cover-up of Joe Biden’s condition has not gone away. And that is duly deserved.</p>

Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">AI, Chips, Humanoid Robots: Top Takeaways From Computex 2025</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan, entered its fourth day on Thursday. Tech blog <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/live/computex-2025">Tom's Guide</a> said the spotlight this week has been on AMD's Radeon RX 9060 XT and Nvidia's RTX 5060 gaming GPUs. Other top highlights include Intel's early reveal of next-gen laptop CPUs for 2026 and MSI's debut of its first AMD-powered gaming handheld, the Claw A8.</p>

<p>Breaking down Asia's top AI tech show, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/computex-2025-five-takeaways-from-asia-s-biggest-ai-tech-event">Bloomberg</a> highlighted <strong>five key takeaways from this week:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Consumer AI Needs More Time</strong></p>

<p><em>There was scant mention of consumers this year. In 2024, Qualcomm Inc. devoted its presentation to how AI would make everything better and we'd never again need our laptop chargers on the move. This time around, it flipped to a script focused on enterprise applications for AI.</em></p>

<p><em>Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., used its first keynote address at the show to go big on heavy-duty AI, from making cities smarter to bringing robots to manufacturing and making EV design more efficient. The company that assembles the bulk of the world's iPhones had nothing to excite consumers.</em></p>

<p><em>Asustek Computer Inc. offered a sobering outlook on the prospects of so-called AI PCs.</em></p>

<p><em>Samson Hu, co-chief executive officer of the Taiwanese computer gear maker, said AI PCs will take a year or two before they go mainstream. That's because the software is still immature, plus new tariffs from the US are likely to flatten near-term growth. Asus may have to hike prices in the US by as much as 10% to deal with those levies, Hu said.</em></p>

<p><strong>DeepSeek Changed AI</strong></p>

<p><em>The debut of DeepSeek in January changed the nature of AI, highlighting China's advances in the field while dismantling basic assumptions about computing needs.</em></p>

<p><em>Huang was among the few executives who addressed that first openly, saying that China is "incredible" at software development and has the resources to make up for any technological gap.</em></p>

<p><em>DeepSeek also popularized reasoning models, which require more raw computing power. "And so now the reasoning model is not one shot, but it's hundreds of shots," Huang told reporters this week. "DeepSeek increased the amount of computing need by maybe 100 to 1,000 times."</em></p>

<p><strong>China Looms Large </strong></p>

<p><em>The most-clicked headlines centered around Nvidia's delicate position as the US pursues chip restrictions intended to curtail China's tech ascent. That came to a head Wednesday, when Huang branded that effort a "failure" and called for Washington to back away.</em></p>

<p><em>If the US doesn't allow Nvidia to sell within China, local companies like Huawei Technologies Co. will fill the void, he warned. "The local companies are very, very talented and very determined," Huang said. "And the export controls gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development." </em></p>

<p><em>While key officials in Washington buy that argument as it applies to the rest of the world, US President Donald Trump's administration has doubled down on measures targeting Beijing. </em></p>

<p><em>Executives in Taiwan no doubt took note of two related developments. Huawei hosted its AI developer gathering the same week, touting the Ascend chips that Beijing wants to see supplant Nvidia's silicon. And Xiaomi Corp. happened to announce it's developed its own advanced 3-nanometer mobile chip to compete with Qualcomm.</em></p>

<p><strong>Taiwan Charm Offensive</strong></p>

<p><em>Intel Corp.'s new boss worked hard to mend ties with the Taiwanese partners, after his predecessor Pat Gelsinger raised concerns about the island's dominance in semiconductors.</em></p>

<p><em>Lip-Bu Tan praised local supply chain partners during a company event in Taipei celebrating its 40th anniversary on Monday.</em></p>

<p><em>Even Nvidia dedicated much time and floor space at the conference to lauding its Taiwanese partners. SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son was also in town for the week, though like Tan he was keeping a low public profile.</em></p>

<p><strong>No Bubble? </strong></p>

<p><em>There was little public discussion about one of the most pressing questions for tech investors: have we overestimated the need for datacenters? Tech stocks from Nvidia to Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have gyrated wildly in 2025 in part because of that overarching uncertainty.</em></p>

<p><em>To be sure, most of the attendees benefit directly from spending on the servers and components needed to power datacenters and AI development. Nvidia's CEO echoed the sentiment.</em></p>

<p><em>"We're several hundred billion dollars into tens of trillions of dollars of AI infrastructure buildout," Huang said.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With all the major announcements already made earlier in the week, the Computex conference will wrap up on Friday.</p>

<p>Goldman analyst Eddy Kuo attended the conference. In a note on Thursday, he pointed out that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang "is optimistic for humanoid robotics and commented it will be the core of the future economy, and Taiwan is playing a key role in this area integrating AI and humanoid robots." </p>

<p>Late Wednesday evening there is currently a <strong>massive ongoing police response</strong> in northwest Washington DC outside the Capital Jewish Museum, after gunfire erupted just outside which <strong>killed two staff members of the Israeli Embassy</strong>.</p>

<p>"<strong>Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight</strong> near the <strong>Jewish Museum </strong>in Washington DC," Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed in a post on X. "We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share."</p>

<p>The shooting occurred across the street from the FBI’s Washington Field Office, which is located very near to the museum, and Israeli embassy officials are working with local law enforcement and the FBI.</p>

<p>It has further been confirmed that the Israeli ambassador is safe, and was not involved in the incident, and was not present at the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Underscoring the seriousness of the killings, which appear to have targeted an event which took place at the Jewish Museum, <strong>US Attorney General Pam Bondi amd acting US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro are currently on the scene in the aftermath</strong>. </p>

Title: Gold And The Great American Monetary Resets: From 1792 To Today
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Gold And The Great American Monetary Resets: From 1792 To Today</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://internationalman.com/articles/gold-and-the-great-american-monetary-resets-from-1792-to-today/">Authored by Nick Giambruno via International Man</a>,</em></p>

<p><strong>Gold has been at the heart of the US monetary system since the nation’s founding, evolving from a direct anchor for the dollar to a strategic reserve asset.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/gold-reset-shutterstock_1571108095_jpg_92.jpg?itok=JNgyMWBA" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold-reset-shutterstock_1571108095_jpg_92.jpg?itok=JNgyMWBA"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="883a2c15-1f46-4200-8ecd-47d38b8c4247" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="263" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold-reset-shutterstock_1571108095_jpg_92.jpg?itok=JNgyMWBA" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Though it no longer backs the dollar, gold remains a cornerstone of central bank reserves, a discreet but powerful force in global finance.</p>

<p>Throughout American history, monetary resets have been a recurring theme—and more often than not, they have revolved around gold because gold is money.</p>

<p>Understanding this history isn’t just about the past—it’s about the future. And if history is any guide, another reset may be coming sooner than most expect.</p>

<h3>1775: Continentals and the American Revolution</h3>

<p>Before the Revolution, gold and silver coins were the backbone of trade in the American colonies.</p>

<p><strong>When war broke out, the Continental Congress lacked the authority to levy taxes, forcing them to seek an alternative way to finance the war.</strong></p>

<p>In 1775, Congress began issuing “Continental Currency”—the first fiat paper money in US history. These notes, known as “Continentals,” were supposed to be redeemable in gold and silver after the war, but that promise lacked credibility.</p>

<p>Continentals quickly became worthless amid hyperinflation. <strong>The phrase “Not worth a Continental” became synonymous with worthlessness.</strong></p>

<p>By 1781, Continentals had lost over 99% of their value, and the US government effectively abandoned them, leaving holders with massive losses.</p>

<p>This disaster deepened distrust in fiat money and cemented the belief among the Founders that gold and silver must be the foundation of any stable monetary system.</p>

<h3>1792: The Coinage Act and the Birth of the US Monetary System</h3>

<p>After the disastrous failure of Continental Currency, the Coinage Act of 1792 created the first official US monetary system, ensuring stability by tying the dollar to both gold and silver.</p>

<p>Gold was set at $19.39 per ounce, while silver was also legal tender.</p>

<p>The Founders aimed to prevent another Continental-style collapse by anchoring the currency to hard money.</p>

<h3>The First Bank of the United States (1791–1811)</h3>

<p>The First Bank of the United States, the nation’s first central bank, was established under the leadership of Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the economy, issue a national currency backed by gold and silver, and manage federal deposits.</p>

<p>However, it quickly became a political flashpoint, facing fierce opposition from Thomas Jefferson and states’ rights advocates, who feared it concentrated too much financial power in the hands of the federal government.</p>

<p>When the bank’s 20-year charter expired in 1811, Congress refused to renew it.</p>

<h3>The Second Bank of the United States (1816–1836)</h3>

<p>In the wake of the financial chaos following the War of 1812, the US established another central bank, the Second Bank of the United States, in 1816.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, it was designed to regulate credit, stabilize the currency, and hold federal deposits.</p>

<p>However, it quickly became a political lightning rod, particularly under President Andrew Jackson, who saw it as a corrupt institution that served elite interests at the expense of ordinary Americans.</p>

<p>Jackson vetoed its recharter in 1832, waged a successful campaign against it, and ultimately dismantled the bank in 1836.</p>

<h3>1834: First Major Price Change ($20.67 per Ounce)</h3>

<p>The Coinage Act of 1834 officially raised the gold price to $20.67 per ounce, effectively devaluing the US dollar (since more dollars were now needed to buy an ounce of gold).</p>

<p>The $20.67 per ounce gold price remained unchanged for nearly a century until FDR’s intervention in 1933.</p>

<h3>1862: Lincoln’s Greenbacks – The Civil War Fiat Experiment</h3>

<p>During the War Between the States (1861–1865), President Abraham Lincoln introduced a fiat paper currency known as “Greenbacks” to finance the war effort. This marked a major departure from the gold and silver-based system that had defined US money.</p>

<p>The war demanded enormous financial resources, but the government lacked sufficient gold and silver reserves to cover costs. Traditional borrowing through bond sales proved insufficient, and policymakers were reluctant to impose heavy taxation on the public. In response, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862, authorizing the issuance of paper money not backed by gold or silver—these notes became known as “Greenbacks” due to their distinctive color.</p>

<p>Although Greenbacks allowed the government to fund the war, they were not backed by hard assets, leading to debasement. After the war, the US took steps to restore confidence in the monetary system and return to a gold-backed standard.</p>

<p>In 1869, the Public Credit Act was passed, pledging that Greenbacks would eventually be redeemable in gold, reassuring creditors. This was followed by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875, which mandated that by 1879, Greenbacks would once again be convertible into gold. By then, the US had reduced the number of Greenbacks in circulation, successfully returning to a gold-based monetary system and ending their fiat status.</p>

<p>Although Greenbacks were a temporary fiat currency, their detachment from gold foreshadowed future monetary shifts.</p>

<h3>1913: The Federal Reserve Act</h3>

<p>The creation of the Federal Reserve—the nation’s third central bank—marked a significant shift toward centralized control over the US monetary system.</p>

<p>While gold remained part of the system, the Federal Reserve’s ability to expand credit beyond physical gold reserves weakened gold’s direct role in the monetary system. This shift set the stage for future monetary interventions, inflationary policies, and the eventual abandonment of gold convertibility in 1971.</p>

<h3>1933: FDR’s Gold Confiscation (Executive Order 6102)</h3>

<p>In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) issued Executive Order 6102, forcing Americans to turn in their gold coins and bullion to the US Treasury. This move was intended to give the government greater control over the money supply and combat deflation during the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Citizens were paid $20.67 per ounce for their gold, but shortly after, the government revalued gold at $35 per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar by 41%. The change allowed the government to print more dollars without increasing gold reserves.</p>

<p>In a national radio address on October 22, 1933, Roosevelt justified the decision, stating:</p>

<p>“The United States must take firmly in its own hands the control of the value of our dollar.”</p>

<p>Gold ownership was banned for private citizens until 1974, and much of the nation’s gold was centralized in Fort Knox. This marked a decisive step in the government’s tightening control over the monetary system.</p>

<h3>1944: The Bretton Woods Agreement – The Dollar Becomes the Global Reserve Currency</h3>

<p>It’s been rightly said that “he who holds the gold makes the rules.”</p>

<p>After World War 2, the US had the largest gold reserves in the world by far. Along with winning the war, this let the US reconstruct the global monetary system around the dollar.</p>

<p>The new system, created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, tied the currencies of virtually every country in the world to the US dollar through a fixed exchange rate. It also tied the US dollar to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce.</p>

<p>However, the Bretton Woods Agreement was doomed to fail.</p>

<p>Runaway spending on warfare and welfare eventually caused the US government to print more dollars than it could back with gold at the promised $35 price.</p>

<h3>1971: Nixon Ends Gold Convertibility (“Nixon Shock”)</h3>

<p>By the late 1960s, the number of dollars circulating had drastically increased relative to the amount of gold backing them. This encouraged foreign countries to exchange their dollars for gold, draining the US gold supply at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>As a result, the US gold supply dropped by more than half, from 574 million troy ounces at the end of World War II to around 261 million troy ounces in 1971.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/word-image-65622-1_png_92.jpg?itok=CpCTGWEr" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/word-image-65622-1_png_92.jpg?itok=CpCTGWEr"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="be07e069-9c27-4d92-8656-12256322f5a4" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="311" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/word-image-65622-1_png_92.jpg?itok=CpCTGWEr" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The situation pressured the US government to make a drastic decision.</p>

<p>It could do nothing and watch its gold holdings evaporate, which would mean losing enormous financial and geopolitical power. Or it could default on its promise to redeem the dollar for gold.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, August 15, 1971, President Nixon interrupted the scheduled TV programs and made a surprise announcement to the nation—and the world.</p>

<p>Nixon said he was temporarily suspending the dollar’s convertibility into gold.</p>

<p>The most obvious lie was Nixon’s claim that the suspension would only be “temporary.” It’s still in place today.</p>

<p>Another egregious lie was that his move was necessary to protect Americans from international speculators. Instead, money printing to finance out-of-control government spending was the real problem.</p>

<p>Lastly, Nixon said removing the link to gold would stabilize the dollar. However, even by the government’s own rigged inflation statistics, which understate reality, the US dollar has lost over 87% of its purchasing power since 1971.</p>

<p>The truth is that Nixon defaulted on the US government’s promise to redeem the dollar for gold at $35 an ounce. Since then, the dollar has been a pure fiat currency with no backing.</p>

<h3>1972 – The Smithsonian Agreement Adjusts the Gold Price to $38</h3>

<p>After the Nixon Shock, world leaders met in December 1971 to try and stabilize the international monetary system. The Smithsonian Agreement attempted to:</p>

<ul><li>Raise the official gold price from $35 to $38 per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar by 8.5%.</li>
	<li>Allow major currencies to fluctuate within a 2.25% band instead of being strictly fixed.</li>
</ul><p>However, confidence in the dollar continued to erode, and the agreement collapsed by 1973, paving the way for the modern floating exchange rate system, where gold would trade freely on the open market.</p>

<h3>1973: The US Dollar and Gold Officially Float</h3>

<p>After multiple attempts to stabilize exchange rates—including the Smithsonian Agreement (1971)—major currencies transitioned to a free-floating system in early 1973, allowing exchange rates to fluctuate based on market forces.</p>

<p>As the US dollar continued to weaken, another official devaluation occurred in February 1973, raising the official gold price from $38 to $42.22 per ounce. This represented a total devaluation of 20.7% compared to the original $35 peg established under Bretton Woods.</p>

<p>However,<strong> despite these adjustments, it became clear that the US could no longer control gold’s value in global markets.</strong></p>

<p>By March 1973, the Smithsonian Agreement collapsed, and major currencies—including the US dollar—shifted to a fully floating exchange rate system. This marked the end of government-controlled gold pricing as the US stopped setting an official price. Gold began trading freely on the open market, and its price was determined by supply and demand rather than government decree.</p>

<p>While August 15, 1971, marked the end of gold convertibility under the Nixon Shock, the US still attempted to maintain an official gold price under the Smithsonian Agreement. However, this system ultimately failed.</p>

<p>Gold officially began trading freely in March 1973, when the floating exchange rate system was adopted, allowing the market to set gold’s value independently for the first time since the nation’s founding.</p>

<p>Below is a chart depicting the 181-year history of gold’s official role in the US monetary system—from the Coinage Act of 1792 to 1973.</p>

<p>Each gold price adjustment marks a rare but significant event, reflecting dollar devaluations and major monetary resets that reshaped the financial system.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Gold as a Financial Asset (1973–Present)</h3>

<p>Before the adoption of a fiat currency standard after the end of Bretton Woods, gold had been mankind’s most enduring form of money—for over 5,000 years—because of unique characteristics that made it best suited to store and exchange value.</p>

<p>Gold is durable, divisible, consistent, convenient, scarce, and most importantly, the “hardest” of all physical commodities.</p>

<p>In other words, gold is the one physical commodity that is the “hardest to produce” (relative to existing stockpiles) and, therefore, the most resistant to debasement.</p>

<p><strong>Gold is indestructible, and its stockpiles have built up over thousands of years. That’s a big reason why the growth of new gold supply—typically 1-2% per year—is insignificant.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, nobody can arbitrarily inflate the supply.</p>

<p>That makes gold an excellent store of value and gives the yellow metal its superior monetary properties.</p>

<p>People in every country of the world value gold. Its worth doesn’t depend on any government or any counterparty at all. Gold has always been an inherently international and politically neutral asset. This is why different civilizations around the world have used gold as money for millennia.</p>

<p>Yet, most people don’t understand this.</p>

<p>They might say the paper dollars in their wallets and the digital dollars in their bank accounts are money, not gold. But that’s only been the case since 1971, a drop in the bucket by historical terms.</p>

<p>The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 was a turning point, severing gold’s link to the dollar and transforming it from a fixed monetary anchor into a freely traded financial asset. Even though it is no longer legal tender, gold has retained its status as a store of value, trusted by governments, central banks, and investors worldwide. Its role as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and economic instability has only strengthened over time.</p>

<p><strong>Despite abandoning the gold standard, central banks continue to hold and accumulate gold, recognizing its importance as a financial asset.</strong></p>

<p>This is what makes gold fundamentally different from other commodities like wheat, copper, or oil. While those goods are consumed, gold is primarily held as a financial asset, making its price a critical indicator of global economic stability, currency strength, and monetary policy credibility.</p>

<p>The price of gold is a barometer of the fiat currency system itself. It is a real-time measure of confidence (or lack thereof) in the monetary system because it is a free market alternative to government-issued money.</p>

<p>Throughout history, every major monetary reset in the United States has revolved around gold—from the Coinage Act of 1792, to FDR’s gold confiscation in 1933, to the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971. Each time, the dollar was devalued, and gold played a central role in reshaping the financial system.</p>

<p><strong>This is no coincidence—gold has been mankind’s most enduring form of money for thousands of years, making it only natural that it would play a central role in any major monetary shift.</strong></p>

<p>Today, the conditions are ripe for a monetary reset in the US, and history leaves little doubt—gold will once again be at the center of it. If past resets are any indication, a significant dollar devaluation is not just possible, but practically inevitable.</p>

<p>Trump’s Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, all but confirmed that a monetary reset is imminent when he recently stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re in the midst of a great realignment, a Bretton Woods realignment in terms of global policy, global trade… I’d like to be part of it, either on the inside or the outside.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stage is set. History shows every major US monetary reset has revolved around gold—and 2025 could be next. With debt exploding, the dollar overvalued, and gold flowing quietly into US vaults, the writing is on the wall.</p>

<p>What happens next could change everything.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve just released an urgent new report revealing the top three strategies you need to prepare—and profit—from what’s coming next.</p>

Title: Watch: Harmeet Dhillon Exposes DOJ's 'Color Revolution' Wing: Secret 'Resistance' Memos, 'Unhappy Hours,' & 'Crying Sessions'
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Watch: Harmeet Dhillon Exposes DOJ's 'Color Revolution' Wing: Secret 'Resistance' Memos, 'Unhappy Hours,' & 'Crying Sessions'</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>In a revealing interview with Tucker Carlson,<strong> Harmeet Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, pulled back the curtain on the entrenched resistance within the Department of Justice</strong>, which she described as a stronghold of the deep state. <strong>Dhillon revealed a culture of anti-MAGA defiance</strong>, marked by resistance memos circulating among career lawyers, instructing them to obstruct directives through bureaucratic tactics. Dhillon also recounted a hilarious scene of <strong>open crying sessions in the DOJ halls</strong> and mass resignations as hundreds of attorneys recoiled at her push to align the division with the Trump administration’s agenda.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFbAQKMZnb4?si=JdiE3A6QbFWONECb&start=264" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>TUCKER CARLSON: Your assistant attorney general, one of the greatest appointments, from my perspective, in this administration, running the civil rights division. What was it like when you showed up? What did you find when you got there?</p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLON: <strong>The civil rights division is the color revolution wing of the Department of Justice</strong>. Okay, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat administration, there are career lawyers who are very focused on a particular agenda there. <strong>So, when I showed up, or when I was, when the president was elected, I should say, there were over 400 attorneys in the civil rights division and about 200 staff, so a total of about 600 people.</strong> Kristen Clark, my predecessor, anti-police, open racist, got in trouble during her term for not being candid with the Senate during her confirmation hearings on some issues. So, she had a particular agenda. She got in there and she pursued that agenda aggressively. And she had all the staff to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Now, under the first Trump administration, my predecessor in that job pretty much left it untouched. </strong>He told me he kind of, like, there were the career people there, if he wanted to get something done, they went to the U.S. attorney's offices. I came in with a different perspective. I think it's part of the promise of this administration under President Trump to fundamentally reform the government in the way that the people voted for. That means, in the civil rights division, we should be standing up for the civil rights of all Americans, not just some Americans. We shouldn't be weaponizing the law in a particular way. We should apply those federal civil rights statutes, many of which were passed by and signed by Republican presidents and Republican administrations, evenly, and the government shouldn't be putting its heavy thumb on the scale in most cases. But in egregious instances, we should step forward and right these wrongs.</p>

<p><strong>But what I found there was a number of lawyers, I mean hundreds of lawyers, who were actively in resistance mode.</strong> There were memos out there by former government lawyers telling current government lawyers in my department how to resist if you're given a direct order. Ask for clarification, send 20 emails, question it, slow down your response time, say it can't be done. So, I was actually looking out for that when I came. I did my week of training after getting confirmed by the Senate. And then the next week, I was like, "Okay, guys, it's time to get to business. I want everyone to be very clear what the agenda is here.”</p>

<p>So, there are 11 sections in civil rights, and I drafted memos for each of those 11 sections for the lawyers, telling them, these are the statutes. So, for example, Americans with Disabilities Act, this is the statute that we enforce, or Title 7 anti-discrimination, or some of the other federal civil rights statutes. And then that's the baseline. And then this is the president's agenda. These are his executive orders that he's put out there about anti-discrimination, about anti-DEI, about enforcing our laws equally. And that's the job. You are going to apply these statutes within the framework of anti-discrimination, even-handedly and without fear or favor. And this catalyzed hundreds of lawyers to quit the civil rights division.</p>

<p>TUCKER CARLSON: <strong>So, wait, they quit because you informed them of the law? </strong></p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLON: Yes. And the law and the priorities, their pet projects had changed. </p>

<p>TUCKER CARLSON: They weren't going to be able to do those the way that they wanted. And so, they thought that this part of the Department of Justice was just immune to democracy.</p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLON: It has been, I mean, there were career lawyers there who were doing the same thing no matter who's a president. <strong>And so, suddenly, their little fiefdom that had remained untouched, like Shangri-La, was suddenly having to be responsive to elections. </strong></p>

<p>TUCKER CARLSON: That's the definition of the deep state, what you just described. Elections have no effect. It's like there's no way to control these people. They act totally independently from the democratic system. I mean, that's the problem right there.</p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLO<strong>N: Well, that's what I found. And so, in response to my memos, of course, </strong>they began leaking to the press. They began having unhappy hours, which they would invite supervisors, political supervisors, to, to make their point that they were unhappy. We got the point. And they had crying sessions, struggle sessions, crying sessions in the DOJ. </p>

<p>TUCKER CARLSON: They cried? </p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLON: Oh, t<strong>here was open crying in the halls. Crying, crying, crying. Yes.</strong> And then one of my colleagues described to me, it was the last day a couple of weeks ago for some of them. They lined up in a phalanx and approached the elevator together, and then they left the building together, to show their solidarity for one another there, as if they were high school students or adults.These are 30, 40, and 50-year-old career attorneys in the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>HARMEET DHILLON: It's pathetic.</p>

Title: Senators Question Spending Cuts In Key Nuclear, Science Programs
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Senators Question Spending Cuts In Key Nuclear, Science Programs</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/senators-question-spending-cuts-in-key-nuclear-science-programs-5861389">Authored by John Haughey via The Epoch Times</a> (emphasis ours),</em></p>

<p>A day after the Tennessee Valley Authority <a href="https://www.tva.com/news-media/releases/tva-submits-nation-s-first-construction-permit-application-for-bwrx-300-smr">announced</a> it had filed a permit to install the nation’s first small modular nuclear reactor, <strong>Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the breakthrough marks the dawn of a new era in commercial electrical power and that sustaining momentum in advanced nuclear generation is the nation’s “next Manhattan Project.”</strong></p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_0.jpg?itok=PjOLXxjn" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_0.jpg?itok=PjOLXxjn"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a1f460da-2dce-4a7b-979b-656db69a516a" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_0.jpg?itok=PjOLXxjn" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Test engineer Jacob Wilcox pulls his arm out of a glove box used for processing sodium at TerraPower, a company developing and building small nuclear reactors in Everett, Wash., on Jan. 13, 2022.

<p>“<strong>America must lead the commercialization of affordable and abundant nuclear energy</strong>,” he told the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. The Department of Energy “is working to advance the rapid deployment of next generation nuclear technology, including small modular reactors.”</p>

<p>Eventually, perhaps within a decade, small nuclear modular nuclear reactors, or<strong> SMRs, will be mass-produced,</strong> be portable, and ideal for “harnessing our energy potential to power global AI leadership while meeting growing energy demand,” Wright <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/secretary_wright_testimony.pdf">testified</a>, calling commercial deployment of such “next-generation technology … the challenge of our time.”</p>

<p>If so, Democrats and several Republicans wondered during a two-hour <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/a-review-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2026-budget-request-for-the-department-of-energy">May 21 hearing</a>, why is the Trump administration seeking to cut budgets for the department’s Office of Nuclear Energy by nearly 47 percent and its Office of Science by 87 percent in its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">Fiscal Year ( FY) 2026 spending request</a>?</p>

<p>“<strong>On one hand, you and the president say you support U.S. dominance in energy, emerging technologies</strong>,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said, “but then, on the other hand, you are proposing cutting over $1 billion dollars in funding to the Office of Science” and $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy.</p>

<p>She said the still-vague spending request, a broad outline crafted by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and not by the department itself, is counterintuitive to the Trump administration’s pledge to “win the AI race against China.”</p>

<p>The previous FY25 Department of Energy budget earmarked $8.6 billion for the Office of Science and nearly $770 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy, key allocations that leverage federal seed money to induce private investment in financing demonstrations of emerging technologies.</p>

<p>The stark slashes in such funding “really undermines critical research programs for AI, for fusion, for quantum computing, for nuclear energy, and critical minerals,” Murray said. “<strong>How are investors and companies supposed to have confidence in partnering with you when what you say and what your budget says are two different things?”</strong></p>

<p>Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) asked Wright for assurances that the budget will include funding for SMR development and research into other emerging reactor technologies underway in her state, and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) stressed how important federal support for commercial nuclear power is for his state and for the nation.</p>

<p>“The United States is at a pivotal moment in energy production. It’s not just for our nation, it’s for the entire world,” Hagerty said. “<strong>Tennessee has been at the forefront of what you’ve called yourself ‘the Manhattan Project 2.0.’”</strong></p>

<p>SMRs and emerging nuclear technologies were among an array of topics discussed during the Senate’s first hearing on the Department of Energy’s proposed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">$45.1 billion budget</a>, which cuts $19.3 billion in funding for Biden Era “green energy” initiatives, including slashing three-quarters of approved allocations for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, which didn’t include nuclear power options.</p>

<p>The tentative request is 9.4 percent less than FY25’s $52 billion department budget. Beyond a 25-percent increase in funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the nation’s nuclear weapons programs, it trims spending by 18.2 percent, cutting $15.2 billion in allocations from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and $2.6 billion from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.</p>

<p>The “green energy” cuts were telegraphed by President Donald Trump during his campaign and in his executive orders but the massive rollbacks in energy innovation investments are surprising, Murray said.</p>

<p>“<strong>It feels like you want to gift-wrap the future and hand it to China</strong>,” she told Wright.</p>

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) speaks during the weekly Senate presser in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington on July 9, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<h2>More Money Coming</h2>

<p>Wright assured senators that the administration will not cripple research and development of SMRs and other emerging technologies by pulling money from ongoing demonstration programs.</p>

<p>He said his department is reshuffling allocations from Biden era “intermittent” energy programs, such as solar and wind, and reorganizing its offices and staffing to be more focused on advancing technologies that will triple the nation’s electrical capacity in the coming decades.</p>

<p>Wright acknowledged the department has not yet finalized its formal spending request, cautioning that in its tentative state, “Each individual line item does not indicate a policy.”</p>

<p>“<strong>The nuclear industry is quite enthusiastic and quite confident they’re going to have the best environment ever for commercial nuclear power under this administration</strong>,” he said. “What we’re doing is mobilizing tens of billions of dollars of private capital using the government” allocations to anchor those investments.</p>

<p>Wright said the department has offered land near or at its 16 national labs. “We’ve had tons of solicitations to come build on our land,” he said.</p>

<p>Britt said that <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/us-china-nuclear-fusion-race-the-battle-for-energy-and-military-dominance-5828992">communist China</a> has “at least 28 nuclear reactors that are in construction, which is about half of the construction of all nuclear reactors across the entire globe,” so time is of the essence.</p>

<p>Wright said that deregulation and permitting reform are top priorities in ensuring that the United States will meet that challenge.</p>

<p>“China is moving full speed ahead with nuclear. In fact, the most reactors they’re building [are], essentially, a knockoff, a stealing of American reactor technology,” he said. “But they build them much cheaper and much faster, and they don’t have the giant bureaucratic regulatory overhang we have in the United States.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_1.jpg?itok=3LT6xyMN" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_1.jpg?itok=3LT6xyMN"><picture><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images"><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6fb0cf85-cfba-4d8d-84ed-a51c2f2f2ba4" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="281" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_92%2883%29_1.jpg?itok=3LT6xyMN" typeof="foaf:Image" width="500" /><figcaption><em>Artist rendition of NuScale Power’s small modular nuclear reactor plant. NuScale</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>Under current regulations, Wright said, New York’s Grand Central Station “could not be licensed as a nuclear reactor because its radiation is too high.”</p>

<p>The department’s pitch to commercial providers is, “We‘ll be fast, we’ll be efficient. We‘ll help you get going. We’ll arrange creative incentives for you to build nuclear reactors in our space. I think we'll do it.”</p>

<p>Hagerty asked how the department can be play “a central role in advancing and achieving American energy dominance and grid liability” by advancing SMRs at commercial scale.</p>

<p>Wright said it is prudent to be careful when investing in “first-mover” prototypes to ensure that taxpayer money is wisely spent on systems that will work.</p>

<p><strong>“I am all-in with you on advancing nuclear</strong>,” he told Hagerty, and offered an analogy to illustrate why patience is needed while the department restructures loan programs away from renewables to nuclear and other baseload generation.</p>

<p>“Imagine if the Department of Defense sent out a quote to the defense companies, and said, ‘We want to buy tanks. We'll pay full price for high-performance tanks, but you can deliver a tank that only moves some of the time, maybe when the sun’s shining, and will shoot, maybe, when the wind’s blowing,’” Wright said of intermittent power generators.</p>

<p>The Biden administration was paying full price for “an underperforming tank” while providing subsidies to the factories to build them, he said.</p>

<p>“So what do you think is going to happen?” Wright asked. “You’re going to get paid to deliver an inferior tank and a subsidy. Of course, you’re going to do it.</p>

<p>“And then what happens to your army? It’s not just the poor kids that are in those tanks, it’s the kids that are in all the other tanks that now have underperforming partners in the battle that are at risk.”</p>

Title: Iran Will Hold US Responsible For Any Israeli Attack On Nuclear Sites: Foreign Minister
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Iran Will Hold US Responsible For Any Israeli Attack On Nuclear Sites: Foreign Minister</span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Earlier this week CNN had issued an alarming report claiming that Israel is currently <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/israel-subject-unprecedented-pressured-allies-over-gaza-escalation">preparing possible preemptive strikes</a> on Iranian nuclear facilities. It underscored that at this moment it has become very clear that Netanyahu could care less about 'pressure' from Western allies the US, UK, and Canada regarding the Gaza crisis. Israel continues to essentially be at war on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Parallel to all of this, Washington and Iran have been engaged in productive talks on potentially reaching a fresh nuclear deal - which the Netanyahu fundamentally sees as but an Iranian ploy to buy time as it secretly develops nukes (in Tel Aviv's thinking). <strong>But Iran's leaders are calling for the United States to essentially 'keep its dog on a leash' - as Israel wishes to torpedo a deal</strong>.</p>

<p>In fresh statements, Iran now says it <strong>will hold the United States responsible</strong> in the event of an unprovoked Israeli attack on its nuclear energy sites. Certainly any such attacks would completely derail efforts to reset relations with Washington.</p>

<p>"Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime of Israel and will decisively respond to any threat or unlawful act by this regime," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated in a letter addressed to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p>"I have called on the international community to take effective preventive measures against the continuation of Israeli threats, which if unchecked, <strong>will compel Iran to take special measures in defense of our nuclear facilities and materials</strong>," Araghchi said.</p>

<p><em>Araqchi said <strong>Iran would view Washington as a “participant” in any such attack</strong>, and Tehran would have to adopt “special measures” to protect its nuclear sites and material if threats continued, and the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency would be subsequently informed of such steps.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The nature, content, and extent of our actions will correspond and be proportionate to preventive measures taken by these international bodies in accordance with their statutory duties and obligations," the Iranian top diplomat added.</p>

<p>Washington and Tehran are gearing up for a<strong> fifth round of nuclear talks to be held in Rome this Friday</strong>.</p>

<p>Lately the Ayatollah has weighed in following reports that Iran is ready to halt enrichment altogether and in return get sanctions lifted. Ali Khamenei had called the latest US demands that Iranian enrichment be taken down to zero <strong>"excessive and outrageous,"</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-reviewing-proposal-5th-round-nuclear-talks-2025-05-20/">according</a> to state media on Tuesday. He further expressed doubts that current nuclear talks with the Trump administration will actually lead anywhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Tehran, the parliament has "reaffirmed the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program, <strong>saying that the Islamic Republic has never sought, nor will it seek, to build an atomic bomb</strong>.”</p>

Title: ATF Launches "New Era Of Reform", Encourages Revoked Gun Dealers To Reapply 
Description: <span property="schema:name" class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">ATF Launches "New Era Of Reform", Encourages Revoked Gun Dealers To Reapply </span>

            <div property="schema:text" class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><em>Submitted by <a href="https://www.gunowners.org/">Gun Owners of America</a>,</em></p>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has just announced that it's "ushering in a new chapter" of "transparency, accountability, and partnership with the firearms industry" on its official web page.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-09-26.png?itok=26BnXFig" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-09-26.png?itok=26BnXFig"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0aa952d4-0701-4dd3-8f30-c49748c597bd" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="381" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-09-26.png?itok=26BnXFig" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The most notable of these changes is that ATF has invited those Federal Firearms Licensees who had their licenses revoked by the Biden Administration's "Zero Tolerance" policy to reapply and have their license restored. This change is apparently in accordance with President Trump's executive order "Protecting Second Amendment Rights."</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="" data-image-href="/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-10-19.png?itok=2zB3IAz_" data-link-option="0" href="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-10-19.png?itok=2zB3IAz_"><picture><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0e4fc047-c80d-478e-b2bb-a33ca53bb242" data-responsive-image-style="inline_images" height="319" width="500" class="inline-images image-style-inline-images" src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-05-22_14-10-19.png?itok=2zB3IAz_" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Other major policy changes were also announced, including a pledge to cease "creating entirely new laws based on executive order." </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en" xml:lang="en">🚨BREAKING🚨<br /><br />
ATF just published a list of 10 pro-gun achievements & at least 8 more pro-gun actions that are "in progress":<br /><br />
1. Ceasing to "create entirely new laws by administrative order"<br />
2. Reversing the Biden Ban on importation of non-lethal training ammunition.<br />
3. Ending…</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>This is an excellent start to improving the lives of gun owners and dealers. But not to worry, Gun Owners of America is still working on the complete and total abolishment of ATF, starting with the repealing of laws that give the agency the power to regulate. </p>

<p>If those laws are not abolished, the responsibility of enforcement will be inherited by a larger agency, like the FBI or DEA. A larger, more well-funded agency would be harder to fight on the enforcement of those same unconstitutional gun laws. </p>

<p>So, for the time being- while we still have to deal with the ATF, it's good to have it working on bettering its relationship with law-abiding gun owners rather than actively antagonizing them. </p>

<p>GOA's Senior Vice President Erich Pratt had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"This new chapter marks a rare and welcome shift, as ATF is finally working to repair the damage it's done. Encouraging wrongly targeted dealers to reapply—and pledging to stop inventing laws out of thin air—will be a breath of fresh air for gun owners nationwide. That said, GOA remains committed to the complete abolishment of the ATF. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While these reforms are a step in the right direction, the end goal is to eliminate the agency's power to infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners, once and for all."</p>

Title: The Role of AI in Identity and Access Management for Organizations
Description: <h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://dzone.com/refcardz/identity-and-access-management-2">Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp;</a>is a key pillar of any organization. It plays a vital role in enterprise security—securing the resources and the data of an organization by making sure only authorized users have access. As the IT infrastructure of organizations is growing exponentially and increasing cyber threats, rule based IAM solutions are often insufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To enhance security, streamline processes, reduce operational costs, and adapt to evolving threats, organizations are integrating their IAM systems with Artificial Intelligence (AI). This article examines the technical aspects of how AI is driving a change in IAM for organizations.</p>

Title: Assessing Bias in AI Chatbot Responses
Description: <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><span lang="">Abstract</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span lang="">AI communication in the form of chatbots has brought about a new paradigm of communication and service delivery through the use of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/decoding-large-language-models-and-how-they-work"><span lang="">large language models</span></a><span lang="">&nbsp;(LLMs) like GPT. However, as these technologies are applied in daily life, questions about the bias of the answers given by chatbots also arise. In this paper, the focus will be on discussing the ethical considerations of AI chatbots, including the detection of bias, fairness, and transparency. Bias detection techniques described in the study include fairness metrics, sensitivity analysis, and bias correction algorithms. It also emphasizes the importance of diverse training data and the integration of ethical protocols to avoid radiating bias. The consequences of bias in AI chatbots are explored in a range of cases and actual-life scenarios in settings including healthcare, recruitment, and customer relations and service. The study draws attention to the fact that more work has to be done to make certain that AI chatbots are designed and utilized in a way that is ethical and not deceptive.</span></p>

Title: Knowledge Graph Embeddings and NLP Innovations
Description: <p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems facilitate the structuring of typical natural language queries and consequently retrieve specific, relevant information from knowledge graphs efficiently. Given new advances in <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/supercharge-llms-with-knowledge-graphs">Knowledge Graph</a> Embeddings (KGEs) and the sophistication of <a href="https://dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-with-large-language-models">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a>, significant strides are being made in understanding complex semantic relationships and multi-hop queries. This article provides a comprehensive examination of embedding methodologies, particularly emphasizing advanced negative sampling strategies, and discusses the deployment of cutting-edge NLP architectures, such as RoBERTa, to enhance query representation and retrieval accuracy.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem Synopsis and Importance</strong></h2>
<p>Current KGQA frameworks face substantial obstacles in accurately interpreting, extracting, and reasoning over intricate relational data patterns present in multi-hop queries. These questions are notoriously nuanced and call for the ability to draw complex distinctions and conclusions. Unfortunately, conventional embedding techniques can miss the nuances of these relationships across the entire knowledge graph space, limiting the reliability and performance of KGQA systems. Better continual refinement of knowledge graph embeddings using more sophisticated negative sampling methods and more detailed NLP models creates excellent opportunities for enhancing query interpretation and answer precision.</p>

Title: Code Reviews: Building an AI-Powered GitHub Integration
Description: <p>One common issue with growing teams with an extensive codebase is maintaining the code quality. It requires tremendous effort to maintain the code base, and manual code reviews often create a bottleneck during the development process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One standard practice is to get the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/7-ways-to-manage-pull-requests">pull request</a> (PR) reviewed by a senior engineer before merging it into the code base. But developers often get overloaded with reviews as they continue to deliver their regular tasks and might overlook some of the minute details that end up in production. I personally had an experience where a simple missing null check created a cascading error during migration, ultimately leading to corrupted data in production. Human beings tend to make such mistakes, and it is a very common issue.</p>

Title: Regulate microplastics in drinking water | Science
Description: Microplastic pollution is an emerging but underregulated threat to public health (1–3). Microplastics have the potential to harm human organs and biological systems (4 –6), yet no country has yet established standards to regulate their presence in drinking water. The US state of California has implemented standardized microplastic testing for drinking water (7), and the European Union (EU) introduced a harmonized measurement methodology across its Member States in 2024 (8), but these initiatives lack full regulatory integration. To protect public health, international health authorities and governments should identify and mitigate microplastic contamination by incorporating microplastic limits into drinking water standards.

Title:  美债问题有出路吗？高盛交易员：有三条路，黄金和数字币已经体现了 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">打破美债-美股恶性循环的出路是什么？</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">近日，由于市场对美国财政前景的担忧与日俱增，在周三糟糕的20年期国债拍卖结束后，市场局势急转直下。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">德意志银行分析师George Saravelos指出，目前有两种解决方案：一是对特朗普的巨额减税法案进行“重大修订”，实施更严格的财政政策（意味着更高税收，甚至可能导致经济衰退）；二是使美元贬值，增长美债对外国买家的吸引力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高盛交易部门主管Rich Privorotsky随后进一步表示，<strong>美债收益率飙升已对整体风险资产造成压力，而这场危机最终可能演变为美元贬值和非传统资产（如黄金、加密货币）的崛起。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Privorotsky此前曾论述称，收益率与股市之间的关系是非线性的——一旦前者超过某个阈值，就会开始对后者产生实质影响。</p>
<h2 id="3bea425">打破恶性循环：黄金、加密货币和非美国股票崛起</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Privorotsky认为，市场可能陷入围绕财政预算的“反射性循环”。如果财政支出水平延续且美国经济保持韧性，<strong>压力将集中在两个关键“排气阀”上：长期利率（不直接受美联储控制）和美元。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在Privorotsky看来，解决方案有三条路径：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">大规模削减政府支出（政治上几乎不可能）</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">金融抑制，即通过货币政策来管控收益率曲线（类似日本，但将破坏美联储独立性）</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">美联储或财政部干预美元（可能引发货币战争）</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">这些选项都不容易，也都不支持美元走强，因此这解释了为何资金正涌入两类非传统资产：黄金和加密货币。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Privorotsky进一步指出，<strong>黄金、加密货币和美国以外股市的优异表现，将传递出市场可能已经开始为这些结构性压力定价的信号，而且实现第三步（美国以外股市）的路径正在实时勾勒出来。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">关税利空基本面，美股前景堪忧</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">那么，这对美国股市意味着什么？</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Privorotsky建议退一步看问题。他认为，最近几周，很明显有很多与价格无关的技术性需求推动市场，当然净额并不高，而且在没有波动性增加的情况下，这种波动性压缩将推动股票需求。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">考虑到高昂的关税税率中有将有很大一部分间接由美国消费者支付，Privorotsky认为，<strong>股市的风险与回报比看起来很差：</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“关税相当于一种新税收。利率更高，而非更低…很难说基本面增长将受益，临时的需求前置现在大多也已结束。波动性已被重置，且有上升空间。”</p>

Title:  摩根大通贷款超70亿美元，全额覆盖OpenAI阿比林巨型数据中心 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">AI基础设施投资狂潮继续！</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月22日，据科技媒体The Information报道，摩根大通同意向OpenAI位于得克萨斯州阿比林大型AI数据中心园区的建设方提供超过70亿美元贷款。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">知情人士透露，项目建成后将成为全球最大的数据中心之一，能够容纳总计40万片英伟达芯片，显著增强OpenAI的计算能力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通此前已向开发该阿比林数据中心的公司提供了23亿美元贷款，为项目初期阶段提供资金。而最新的70亿美元贷款将完成这个数据中心建设的全部融资。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这表明贷款机构和投资者对支持开发先进AI软件所需的基础设施保持浓厚兴趣。</p>
<h2>AI基础设施投资高涨</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">据介绍，阿比林数据中心项目最初由数据中心开发商Crusoe发起，后来与Blue Owl和Primary Digital Infrastructure成立了一个34亿美元的合资企业，在去年秋季为OpenAI数据中心提供资金。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这个合资企业随后从摩根大通获得了23亿美元建设贷款，足以帮助两个数据中心的初始建设。据The Information早前报道，项目在1月扩大，当时Crusoe与甲骨文签署了更大规模的租赁协议，覆盖整个园区。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，数据中心开发商已经开始扩大拥有该项目的合资企业规模，以建设更多AI数据中心。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Crusoe、Blue Owl和Primary Digital在本周二（5月20日）表示，他们已为扩张再筹集了116亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">另据悉，数据中心建设商CoreWeave周三（5月21日）发行高收益债券筹集了20亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这些贷款和融资表明，投资者对AI领域的过度支出几乎没有担忧。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">科技巨头联手，打造超级计算中心</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">该项目具体建设由数据中心开发商Crusoe负责，部分由资产管理公司Blue Owl和投资基金Primary Digital Infrastructure拥有。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">甲骨文已与数据中心签署15年租约，并将芯片租赁给OpenAI。据介绍，OpenAI计划使用该园区训练其AI模型。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">作为OpenAI的主要支持者，OpenAI过去完全依赖微软提供数据中心算力。但据报道，该初创公司去年对这家科技巨头感到不满，因为其获取芯片的速度不够快。阿比林基地是OpenAI决定与另一家云提供商甲骨文合作获取英伟达GPU的首个案例。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  “万亿美元安全计划”！以太坊要做“未来的结算层”，目标直指“现实资产代币化（RWA）” 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">以太坊正在进行一场公开的“自我重塑”，希望通过“万亿美元安全计划”来巩固其作为未来结算层的地位，并押注现实世界资产的代币化。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月14日以太坊在其官方博客中宣布万亿美元安全计划，<strong>旨在将以太坊定位为个人和机构的未来结算层，以此迎接现实世界资产代币化（RWA）的主流趋势</strong>。这一举措的<strong>核心在于强调以太坊十年来的稳定运行时间和去中心化的验证者集合，以此来证明其有能力保障万亿美元级别的价值</strong>。</p>
<p>根据以太坊官宣内容来看，“万亿美元安全计划”包含三个部分：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>绘制以太坊技术栈各个领域和层面的安全优势和攻击向量图景</strong>。将收集整个生态系统的意见，并将其汇总成一份安全概览报告，帮助我们确定重点关注领域。</li>
<li><strong>落实在地图绘制概述中确定的重点领域的改进</strong>。我们将与生态系统紧密合作，实施近期高优先级的修复措施，并为长期改进项目分配资金。</li>
<li><strong>更有效地沟通以太坊的安全性</strong>。各类用户都应该能够理解、利用并受益于以太坊强大的安全基础。任何人都应该能够评估以太坊的安全标准，并将其与其他区块链和传统系统进行比较。</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，这种雄心勃勃的愿景也引发了质疑。Arca的研究主管Katie Talati认为：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>这更像是一种市场营销策略，而非真正的技术创新</strong>。仅仅依靠这一声明不足以重新吸引开发者和用户的注意力。尽管如此，以太坊的长期发展仍然值得关注，尤其是在用户体验和用户界面方面做出改进之后，或许能吸引更多的开发者。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">有媒体指出，机构投资者对此是否买账也仍未可知。<strong>美国现货以太坊ETF目前尚未获得机构的广泛认可，截至5月15日净流出近4000万美元，同期12只现货比特币基金则净流入80亿美元</strong>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/6a5e8a9e-41ae-4bb6-9848-0bfb342e8ce9.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="463" data-wscnw="703"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尽管ETF和质押收益有望提升以太坊的吸引力，但机构买家是否会被抽象的安全叙事所打动仍有待观察。<strong>他们可能更感兴趣的是收益率、价格上涨以及以太坊发展路线图的保障</strong>。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">以太坊的困境：面临来自Solana的挑战</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据媒体报道，尽管以太坊在技术上不断进步，但其原生代币Ether的表现却差强人意。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">自2022年原有的以太坊主网（ETH1）与信标链（Beacon Chain，即ETH2）结合在一起，以太坊的表现一直落后于比特币。更糟糕的是，以太坊在开发者和用户中的吸引力正在减弱，而Solana等更具吸引力的竞争对手却在崛起。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报道引援Electric Capital的数据表示，<strong>2024年Solana的活跃开发者数量增长了83%，而以太坊则流失了17%</strong>。Solana凭借更低的费用、积极的合作以及迷因币的推动，吸引了年轻、更具实验性的用户群体，也赢得了投资者的兴趣，推动其代币价格创下历史新高。</p>
<p>以太坊的支持者正在寻求改变。由以太坊联合创始人Vitalik Buterin支持、Vivek Raman领导的<strong>新组织Etherealize，旨在为以太坊在华盛顿和机构投资者中发声</strong>。Raman表示</p>
<blockquote>
<p>区块链的安全性是确保信任的最重要品质，<strong>以太坊的目标是成为“数字石油”，与比特币的“数字黄金”相辅相成，构成一个平衡的数字资产投资组合</strong>。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>报道表示，以太坊正在试图将自己定位为坚实、安全、但“无聊”的基础设施。从长远来看，这或许可行。但在这个充斥着追逐短期利益的“degen文化”（高风险高回报）的市场中，以太坊的“万亿美元”愿景可能为时尚早。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  步步紧逼，懂王要废掉哈佛？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">特朗普与精英高校的冲突升级，取消哈佛大学招收国际学生资质。</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.news.cn/20250523/447d574afa164333b6c5d77000d9db2c/c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">据新华社消息，</a>美国政府22日宣布取消哈佛大学获得的学生和交流学者项目资质，禁止该校招收国际学生，目前在校的国际学生也必须转学才能继续其学业。</p> <p style="text-align: left;">根据美国国土安全部当天发表的声明，国土安全部长诺姆宣布了这一决定，<strong>称此举是对全国所有大学和学术机构的警告。</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;">哈佛大学回应称，<strong>这是“违法、报复性的行为”，“可能对哈佛社区和我们的国家造成严重损害”，</strong>并表示：</p> <blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“我们完全致力于维护哈佛接收国际学生和学者的能力，这些人来自140多个国家，他们极大地丰富了大学和这个国家。”</p> </blockquote> <h2 style="text-align: left;">系统性打压：从资金冻结到全面封锁</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">这场对峙可以追溯到2023年10月巴以冲突爆发后的几个月。</p> <p style="text-align: left;">当时，时哈佛大学时任校长Claudine Gay在国会就校园亲巴勒斯坦抗议活动的回应进行作证，引发共和党议员强烈不满。Gay随后辞职，Alan Garber于2024年8月接任校长职位。</p> <p style="text-align: left;">时间线显示，自特朗普2025年1月上任以来，白宫对哈佛的施压逐步升级：</p> <ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">2月：司法部成立专门小组，旨在“根除学校和大学校园中的反犹太骚扰行为”。</p> </li> <li>
<p style="text-align: left;">3月31日：多个联邦部门宣布正式审查哈佛2.556亿美元的合同和87亿美元的多年拨款。</p> </li> <li>
<p style="text-align: left;">4月14日：特朗普政府宣布立即冻结资金，包括22亿美元的多年拨款和6000万美元的多年合同。</p> </li> <li>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月5日：特朗普政府宣布切断所有新的联邦拨款。</p> </li> <li>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月13日：反犹太主义专项工作组宣布再削减4.5亿美元的联邦资金。</p> </li> <li>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月19日：特朗普政表示将使用“虚假索赔法”打击大学的多元、公平和包容(DEI)政策。</p> </li> </ul> <h2 style="text-align: left;">对立加剧：双方法律战开启</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">面对政府的压力，哈佛并没有坐以待毙。</p> <p style="text-align: left;">4月21日，<strong>哈佛对特朗普政府提起诉讼，指控政府违反美国宪法第一修正案，实施“任意和反复无常”的资金削减。</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;">此前，政府向哈佛发出了一系列要求，包括改革学校治理结构以削弱学生和部分教职员的权力，改革招聘和录取做法，拒绝录取被认为“对美国价值观和机构怀有敌意”的学生，取消多元化项目，以及对若干学术项目和中心进行审计。</p> <p style="text-align: left;">哈佛校长Alan Garber强硬拒绝了这些要求，称：“大学不会放弃独立性或放弃宪法权利”。</p> <h2 style="text-align: left;">美国私立大学的运营模式被颠覆？</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">这场政治风暴的影响已超越象牙塔范围。</p> <p>分析指出，哈佛等名校无法招收国际学生，将直接影响其学费收入和全球排名地位，而国际教育服务、学生住房、教育科技等相关产业链都可能受到冲击。</p> <p>美国国土安全部部长诺姆当日还在福克斯新闻采访中称，正考虑在其他大学采取类似举措。</p> <p>值得关注的是，特朗普在社交媒体上多次威胁取消哈佛的免税地位，将其“作为政治实体征税”——<strong>这一威胁如果成真，将从根本上改变美国私立大学的运营模式。</strong></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">据报道，此次量子计算股票集体打仗的直接导火索是IonQ首席执行官Niccolo de Masi发表的一段雄心勃勃的言论：</p>
<blockquote>“<strong>相信IonQ将成为量子计算领域的英伟达</strong>。”</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，摩根士丹利也在最新研报中表达了对整个行业前景的积极态度。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">IonQ野心勃勃欲成&#34;量子英伟达&#34;</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">IonQ首席执行官Niccolo de Masi表示，&#34;我们在量子领域的地位，就像英伟达和博通在GPU领域的地位一样。&#34;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">他进一步强调，&#34;<strong>我相信IonQ将成为量子计算领域的英伟达</strong>。会有其他人复制和跟随我们，他们一直在复制和跟随我们。&#34;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">de Masi补充道，&#34;我们对自己的竞争定位感觉良好，因为归根结底，我们正在努力推动整个生态系统的发展。&#34;</p>
<p>本月早些时候，IonQ公布了一季度财报显示，营收760万美元，略高于分析师预期的750万美元；净亏损3230万美元，较去年同期的3960万美元有所收窄。</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3746663" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及</a>，目前IonQ的商业模式依赖于两条主要收入来源：量子硬件的直接销售以及基于订阅的量子云服务。在一季度报告中，IonQ管理层预计全年营收在7500万至9500万美元之间，同时仍没有提及盈利时间表。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">政府支持与行业前景大幅提振投资者信心</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根大通分析师Samik Chatterjee日前发布了一份关于量子计算的深度报告，虽然尚未对具体量子计算股票进行覆盖，但对整个行业前景持积极态度。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chatterjee在报告中称，预计量子计算将受益于大量投资，仅2025年全球公共投资预计就将达到450亿美元。Chatterjee强调：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#34;全球各国政府不仅将量子技术视为创新的关键领域，而且还投入大量资源加速其发展。这种政府承诺为企业和投资者提供了有力的信号，表明量子技术有望成为未来技术进步和经济增长的基石。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外，投资者也在等待美国国会是否会通过《国家量子倡议重授权法案》，该法案将为量子计算公司及其潜在客户提供资金支持。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据了解，最初的《国家量子倡议法案》是在特朗普首届政府期间于2018年通过的，已于2023年9月失效。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  市场热议“宏观大鳄”豪赌：一家机构狂买“数十亿美元”看涨期权，涉及主要美国科技股 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">神秘期权买家豪赌美股上涨，斥资30亿美元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据彭博社报道，<strong>过去一个月来，有机构投资者稳步买入大量2027年6月到期的美股看涨期权，横跨众多美国大型企业。据野村证券统计，这些期权交易的总期权金接近30亿美元。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">报道称，这位神秘买家的身份尚未确认，但其交易模式一致性极强，表明可能是同一方在建立头寸，也可能有其他投资者在模仿这些交易。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在周三给客户的一份报告中，野村跨资产策略师Charlie McElligott形容<strong>这轮看涨期权买入为“壮观至极”。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">重点押注科技巨头，期权金高昂</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">据悉，这些巨额看涨期权的买入时机恰逢纳斯达克100指数自4月8日以来上涨24%，并集中在科技巨头身上。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">野村数据显示，<strong>这位期权买家在亚马逊的平值看涨期权上花费了3.16亿美元，在Salesforce的类似期权上花费了1.59亿美元，在Arm上更是砸下了惊人的8.78亿美元。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">平值看涨期权即行权价接近市场交易价格水平，这意味着<strong>如果股价上涨，或者波动性增加，期权价值也会随之上升。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得注意的是，由于这些期权距离到期还有数年时间，因此其期权金远高于短期合约。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">例如，周三交易的2200份2027年6月到期、行权价为130美元的ARM看涨期权，每份合同价格高达47.40美元。虽然这笔交易的总期权金高达1040万美元，但交易量仅占整体期权持仓的0.2%。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">旨在做多波动率？</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">在这轮期权买入潮中，<strong>纳斯达克100ETF（QQQ）两年期期权的隐含波动率相对于标普500ETF（SPY）升至今年1月以来的最高水平。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">虽然短期市场波动指标在4月初飙升后有所回落，但QQQ和SPY的60天波动率仍维持在近五年来的高位。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Susquehanna International Group的衍生品策略联席主管Chris Murphy推测，这位买家是“一位资金雄厚、整体偏乐观的全球宏观玩家，<strong>希望通过持有期权，在波动性增加时获利</strong>”。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  华尔街“密切关注”：如果不想利率失控，日本可以这么救日债，但代价是美债！ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">日本长期国债市场正遭遇一轮猛烈抛售，华尔街密切关注一种潜在的救市方案：日本政府或要求国有机构大举买入本国国债，而资金来源，可能是抛售手中的美国国债。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">本周，20年期日本国债拍卖遭遇冷场，收益率飙升，重创长期债券。其中，40年期国债收益率逼近3.7%，自4月以来已上升整整1个百分点。对于久期接近20年的债券，短短几周内投资者损失接近20%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">巴克莱全球研究主席Ajay Rajadhyaksha在接受媒体采访时表示，<strong>如果这种抛售潮持续，日本政府可能不得不动用国有实体来支撑国债市场。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rajadhyaksha提出了一个备受关注的可能路径：像日本邮政、政府养老投资基金（GPIF）等关键机构可能会被“悄悄通知”，需加大国债购买力度。他表示：“如果真有需要，最快的做法就是告诉日本邮政：‘你们得立刻买入500亿美元的长期国债。’”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>但这个方案并非没有代价：为筹措购买日债的资金，这些机构很可能抛售海外资产，首当其冲的便是美国国债——这是日本投资者持有最多的外国债券。</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>日本债市崩盘“幕后推手”</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rajadhyaksha在《金融时报》的评论文章中直言日本债券市场“正陷入困境”，他指出导致日本债市崩溃的几个关键因素：</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>通胀持续高于2%</strong>：日本通胀率目前为3.6%，过去三年一直高于2%，这意味着3.15%的30年期债券收益率实际上是负实际利率。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>传统买家退场</strong>：日本保险公司几乎已停止购买超长期债券，以满足最近引入的经济偿付能力比率要求。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>财政担忧不断加剧</strong>：美国正在敦促日本将国防支出提高到GDP的3%（目前为1.6%）。执政联盟正在考虑追加预算，而反对派则在推动降低消费税。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>日本央行开始量化紧缩</strong>：央行仍然持有惊人的50%以上的日本政府债券。但随着通缩时代结束，央行已开始缩减资产负债表，允许现有债券持有量逐步释放到市场中。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">而日本债市的动荡已经开始影响全球市场。自周二以来，美国30年期国债收益率已上升近20个基点，达到2008年危机以来的最高水平，超过5%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“久期在发达经济体之间是可替代的。如果投资者看到日本国债或英国国债收益率急剧上升，他们会急于在类似债券市场中出售久期敞口。发生在日本的事情不会仅限于日本，”Rajadhyaksha警告道。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>日本有哪些“救市方案”？</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rajadhyaksha在《金融时报》文章中分析了几种可能的解决方案，<strong>包括日本央行可以更快速地提高利率。但上次会议上央行的态度出人意料地更为鸽派，下次会议要等到6月中旬。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rajadhyaksha认为，日本政策制定者通常不倾向于在会议之间采取行动，除非未来几周经济数据显著疲软，否则收益率上升可能会持续。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>在市场急需指引之际，日本央行行长植田和男对国债收益率飙升保持沉默</strong>。据报道，植田和男周四在加拿大班夫参加七国集团财长和央行行长会议后表示：“我不想评论债券收益率短期走势的具体细节，但我当然会继续密切关注。”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">另一种方案是，财政部可以减少发行长期债券，增加短期债券的发行量，以缓解长期利率压力。<strong>但财政部在4月已经这样做了，却没有成功，而且也不愿采取计划外行动。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">因此，通过日本政府“指导”国有机构买债可能是最直接和最有效的方式。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rajadhyaksha承认，日本财务省以这种方式影响准政府机构的投资决策，在政治上将是困难的。但考虑到日本央行不太可能在其预定的决策日期之间改变其政策，因此对于希望控制市场走势的官员来说，这是一个可行的选择。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>不过，即使日本邮政等机构真的介入购买，Rajadhyaksha也坦承这只是临时解决方案，</strong>他表示：“如果你想根据通胀现状或日本财政状况为30年期债券应该保持在目前水平而不是高出50个基点找出基本面理由，我无法做到。”</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  媒体聚焦孙宇晨：曾害怕被捕，如今成特朗普“榜一大哥”，重返美国 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">本周二，34岁的加密货币大亨孙宇晨在社交媒体上确认，他是“特朗普币”的最大持有者，其约2300万美元的持仓使他进入了受邀参加周四与总统私人VIP接待会的25位投资者精英圈子。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">令人惊讶的是，直到特朗普赢得大选前，孙宇晨一直是美国执法机构的目标，在美国加密货币行业的大部分地区都不受欢迎。他经营的波场（Tron）区块链网络已成为加密货币犯罪团伙转移资金的热门渠道。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在特朗普时代加密货币监管可能出现的重大转向的背景下，孙宇晨这一戏剧性转变颇受关注。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">从执法目标到白宫“座上宾”</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">据《华尔街日报》报道，美国财政部金融犯罪执法网络（FinCEN）曾在2023年的一份私人报告中写道，Tron“在非法行为者中的普及度正在上升”。据追踪加密货币交易并与执法部门合作的研究机构TRM Labs称，截至去年，超过一半的非法加密货币活动（约260亿美元）都发生在这个网络上。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">孙宇晨面临美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的指控，该机构在2023年指控他欺诈性地操纵Tron的TRX代币市场。然而，SEC在今年2月要求法院暂停对他的诉讼，这一决定令多位对胜诉充满信心的机构工作人员感到惊讶。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">同时，媒体援引据知情人士透露，美国司法部曾调查孙宇晨涉嫌金融犯罪。曼哈顿美国检察官办公室早在2021年就向孙索取信息，并至少持续到2023年仍在收集证据，这使得他因担心可能被逮捕而避免前往美国。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>孙宇晨的命运在他投资7500万美元于特朗普及其儿子们去年9月推出的加密项目World Liberty Financial后发生转变。他被任命为该企业的顾问，随后开始购买“特朗普币”。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">他与World Liberty的关系帮助他直接接触到特朗普家族。报道称，去年12月，他在阿布扎比比特币会议的VIP后台与币安创始人赵长鹏和Eric Trump一起活动。今年早些时候，孙还与Eric Trump和World Liberty的联合创始人Zach Witkoff（特朗普外交特使Steve Witkoff的儿子）在迪拜的一次会议上进行了“炉边谈话”。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  特朗普减税法案削减税收抵扣，美国光伏股暴跌，核电股上涨 
Description:  <p>特朗普新减税法案对清洁能源行业造成重创，较预期更为激进的补贴削减导致光伏板块暴跌。</p> <p>周四，特朗普的减税法案在共和党控制的众议院以微弱优势通过，美国可再生能源股票随即大幅下挫。据媒体报道，<strong>该法案寻求提前结束清洁能源税收抵免，这些抵免曾是拜登政府《通胀削减法案》(IRA)的核心支柱</strong>。</p> <p>住宅太阳能行业受到的打击尤为严重。5月12日的法案原草案削减了购买太阳能系统的房主的税收抵免。被称为48E的投资税收抵免原定稍后逐步取消，但<strong>该法案最新版本加快了这一商业安装补贴的削减进度</strong>。</p> <p>周四美股收盘，以美国股票为主的Invesco太阳能ETF净资产值下跌高达10%。严重依赖48E资格的Sunrun暴跌近40%，即便美国最大可再生能源开发商NextEra Energy也收盘下跌6.4%。</p> <p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/1dd62660-85d7-4ab3-b53d-397abfda986c.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="487" data-wscnw="676"/></p> <p>分析师警告称，绿色能源股可能还会进一步下跌。法国兴业银行美国股票策略主管Manish Kabra表示：</p> <blockquote>
<p>没有明显的催化剂或理由再持有（美国）太阳能公司。担忧已经存在，我们正意识到这届政府的重点之一是取消绿色补贴。</p> </blockquote> <div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="5b80f6e7">核电股独善其身，投资者目光转向参议院</h2> </div> <p>在这场能源政策大转向中，石化燃料游说团体欢呼法案通过，美国石油协会表示这将有助于&#34;恢复美国能源主导地位&#34;。</p> <p>值得注意的是，<strong>影响核能行业的税收抵免获得豁免，避免了削减，而与先进制造相关的补贴也没有变化</strong>。由Sam Altman持股的小型模块化反应堆公司Oklo股价上涨8%，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2914997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">盘后据报道</a>，特朗普将签署核能命令，Oklo盘后股价继续飙涨18%。</p> <p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/27bedbe6-5256-46b7-bb81-3b69777b3cf5.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="493" data-wscnw="694"/></p> <p>报道指出，投资者关注点现在转向共和党控制的参议院。<strong>参院有权削弱一些最激进的清洁能源激励措施削减，至少四名温和派参议员已表示支持这么做</strong>。然而，摩根大通分析师推测，由于一些原本被认为会支持的众议院共和党人都没有站出来，投资者对股市悲观的态度可能会持续。</p> <p>报道分析表示，虽然参议院可能会调整该法案的某些条款，但清洁能源倡导者警告称，该立法仍可能导致该行业的严重衰退。对于美国清洁能源转型，这将是一个重要的政策转折点。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  市场聚焦的案子判了！美国最高法院：特朗普有权开掉政府官员，但美联储除外 
Description:  <p>在市场对美联储独立性担忧高涨之际，美国最高法院明确划定了总统权力边界：特朗普有权罢免某些政府机构领导人，但该决定不涉及美联储。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">根据媒体报道，美国最高法院周四以7-2的票数作出裁决，允许特朗普罢免国家劳资关系委员会（NLRB）和功绩制保护委员会（MSPB）负责人。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>同时，裁决保护美联储免受特朗普罢免高级官员的影响，法院特别指出美联储是一个“结构独特的准私人实体”。</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">法院多数意见表示，总统可以罢免行使行政权力的官员，但存在有限例外。这项决定很可能会增强特朗普罢免其他机构官员的能力，包括联邦贸易委员会(FTC)和联邦通信委员会(FCC)的官员。</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">美联储成为例外，<strong>鲍威尔“解雇危机”暂缓</strong></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">美联储此次作为裁决中的“例外”，很可能平息市场对特朗普可能解雇美联储主席鲍威尔的担忧。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">特朗普上月曾发出矛盾信号：4月17日在推特宣称“罢免鲍威尔刻不容缓”，五天后却向记者改口称“没有解雇打算”。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">鲍威尔本人曾多次坚称解雇他将是非法的，并在4月表示他不认为最高法院在NLRB和MSPB案件中的裁决会适用于美联储。在11月的新闻发布会上，鲍威尔表示，如果总统要求他离职，他不会离开，他认为法律上也没有这样的要求。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">值得注意的是，美联储及其独立性获得了两党支持。尽管是鲍威尔的公开批评者，民主党参议员Elizabeth Warren警告称，如果鲍威尔主席可以被美国总统解雇，将会导致市场崩盘。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">媒体报道指出，特朗普对美联储不降息的批评以及他威胁要解雇鲍威尔的言论，在上个月引发了金融市场的恐慌，加剧了债券抛售。特朗普坚称他不打算解雇美联储主席后，市场才逐渐平静下来。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">鲍威尔的任期将持续至2026年5月，他多次表示打算完成其任期。然而，这项裁决虽然暂时保护了美联储，但很可能将加强特朗普重组其他监管机构的能力。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title:  美国暂停哈佛大学招收国际学生资格，在校外国学生转学“否则将失去合法身份” 
Description:  <p data-start="0" data-end="51">特朗普政府于周四中止了哈佛大学招收国际学生的资格，特朗普政府通知哈佛大学，禁止其招收国际学生。</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51">美国政府撤销了哈佛大学的学生与交流访问学者项目（SEVP）认证，意味着该校今后不得再招收外国学生。美国国土安全部长克里斯蒂·诺姆（Kristi Noem）致哈佛大学的一封信中写道：“我在此通知您，自即日起，哈佛大学的学生与交流访问学者项目（SEVP）认证被撤销。”</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51"><strong>此举意味着哈佛大学将无法再招收国际学生，现有的外国学生必须转学，否则将失去合法身份。</strong></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51">特朗普政府的这一决定是在美国政府冻结数十亿美元联邦资金后，对哈佛大学造成的最新重大打击。<strong>这标志着特朗普政府与美国精英高校的对立进一步升级，冲突推向前所未有的高度。</strong></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51">根据哈佛大学数据，该校目前约有6800名国际学生，占学生总数的27%，相比2006年的19.6%有显著增长。美国国土安全部长Noem称，有关哈佛大学的命令影响多达27%的在校生。这也是特朗普政府对其他大学的警告。</p>
<h2>美国国土安全部部长致信哈佛</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51"><a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=5225276109837222549&amp;t=1747944249003&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;track_id=BC53BA29-AEED-49FA-ACB6-BB66867A7FE0_769643696185&amp;share_to=copy_url" target="_blank" rel="noopener">据央视新闻</a>，美国国土安全部5月22日表示，特朗普政府已暂停哈佛大学招收国际学生的资格。美国国土安全部部长克里斯蒂·诺姆在致哈佛大学的一封信中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51">哈佛大学的学生和交流访问者项目（SEVP）认证即日起被撤销。</p>
<p data-source="cke">此次认证撤销将使哈佛大学在2025-2026学年不得招收任何持F类或J类非移民身份的外籍学生。此外，现有持F类或J类非移民身份的学生必须转学至其他高校，否则将无法维持其非移民身份。</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-source="cke"><strong>此外，美国国土安全部部长诺姆当日还在福克斯新闻采访中称，正考虑在其他大学采取类似举措。</strong></p>
<p data-start="53" data-end="112">美国国土安全部在声明中指出：“哈佛大学的管理层通过纵容反美、支持恐怖主义的煽动者骚扰并攻击个人，包括多名犹太学生，严重破坏了其曾经声誉卓著的学术环境，从而造成校园不安全。”</p>
<p data-start="53" data-end="112">Noem说，大学能够招收国际学生并借此获得高额学费以补充其数十亿美元的捐赠基金，是一种特权，而非权利。</p>
<p data-start="53" data-end="112">Noem曾在4月要求哈佛大学在4月30日前提交所有涉外学生涉及暴力或非法行为的记录，否则将立即失去其联邦学生签证项目的认证。</p>
<h2 data-start="53" data-end="112">哈佛大学：国土安全部此举“违法”</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="20">哈佛大学对此回应称，美国政府的行为是非法的。据央视新闻，当地时间22日，美国哈佛大学称，<strong data-source="cke">国土安全部阻止其招收国际学生的举动“违法”</strong>。哈佛大学表示将全力维持招收来自140多个国家的国际学生和学者的能力。</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="20">哈佛大学一位发言人在声明中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="0" data-end="20">我们完全致力于维护哈佛接纳来自140多个国家的国际学生和学者的能力，他们为本校——乃至整个国家——带来了难以估量的价值。我们正在迅速采取措施，为校内社区成员提供指导与支持。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 data-start="53" data-end="112">哈佛大学选择“硬刚”</h2>
<p data-source="cke">近期，美国联邦政府以冻结联邦经费为要挟，要求多所高校“整改”，美国著名私立学府哈佛大学则选择“硬刚”。哈佛大学4月14日拒绝了特朗普政府提出的对其管理结构、招聘及招生政策进行大幅改革的要求。美国政府随即宣布冻结该校总额约22.6亿美元的联邦经费。</p>
<p data-source="cke"><strong>禁止招收国际学生的措施将进一步加剧哈佛大学的财政压力。尽管特朗普政府已在其他美国高校削减研究资金并批评多样性举措，但没有任何一所大学像哈佛那样在其重塑高等教育的行动中受到如此严重的打击。</strong></p>
<p data-source="cke">此前当地时间4月18日，特朗普政府表示，已要求哈佛大学提供过去十年来的外国资金及部分外国关系的记录。</p>
<p data-source="cke">特朗普还曾呼吁取消哈佛的免税资格。哈佛警告称，此举将对美国高等教育的未来产生“严重后果”。</p>
<h2 data-start="53" data-end="112">萨默斯、Griffin怒喷特朗普政府</h2>
<p data-start="53" data-end="112">美国前财长萨默斯在社交媒体平台X上发帖称，特朗普政府针对哈佛大学的行动“太过分了”。萨默斯表示，“与来自世界各地数千名最具才华的年轻人为敌是疯狂之举。”</p>
<p data-start="53" data-end="112">上个月，对冲基金巨头Citadel创始人兼首席执行官Ken Griffin认为，特朗普的行为玷污了美国资产曾经“无可比拟”的卓越声誉，包括美国国债、美元强势和国家信用度。美国政府对哈佛大学这所美国顶尖学府的施压，无异于“攻击美国最卓越的品牌之一”。</p>
<h2 data-start="53" data-end="112">法官禁止特朗普的移民部门撤销国际生的合法身份</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="51">另据媒体周四报道，法官禁止特朗普的移民部门撤销国际生的合法身份。一位联邦法官周四阻止了特朗普政府终止国际学生合法身份的做法。</p>
<p data-start="88" data-end="167">加利福尼亚州联邦地区法官Jeffrey White裁定，政府不得逮捕或拘留原告及其他类似的国际学生，也不得将他们转移至其居住地以外的司法辖区。该裁定还禁止政府在案件未审结前，对这些学生施加任何不利的法律后果，或撤销其已恢复的合法身份。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  一票之差！特朗普减税案在众院涉险过关，参院还有难关得过 
Description:  <p>经过表决前最后一刻的修修补补，特朗普2.0任期计划出台的标志性减税法案终于在美国众议院涉险过关，以赞成票仅比反对票多一票的微弱优势被送往参议院。</p>
<p>议案在众院获批后，包括美国总统特朗普在内的共和党人暂时欢呼胜利。而面对美国政府负债加剧的争议，以及共和党党内的斗争，这项提出大规模减税与支出的法案若要在参议院顺利通关，看来还难度不小。参议院的共和党人已经承诺，要对众议院通过的议案版本作出一些改动，那意味着在参议院必然会有一番“撕扯”。</p>
<p>市场观察人士担忧，该法案的举措可能扩大美国政府的预算赤字，导致美债市场承受更大压力。毕竟，从本周三开始，30年期美国国债的收益率就稳处5.0%上方，在周四回落以前，连日创2023年10月以来新高。</p>
<h2>215票对214票，上千页篇幅减税案临“闯关”前数十处修改</h2>
<p>据新华社报道，当地时间5月22日周四，美国众议院以215票赞成、214票反对的表决结果通过一项大规模税收与支出法案。所有民主党议员和两名共和党议员投了反对票，另有一名共和党议员投弃权票。</p>
<p>法案获得众议院通过后，就此被提交参议院，接下来，将由参议院决定，它能否被送往特朗普的办公桌签字成为立法。</p>
<p>媒体指出，在众议院全院表决前，议长约翰逊（Mike Johnson）和其他共和党的领袖进行了长时间的磋商。为了团结温和派和强硬保守派，最近两天，在临投票前，共和党人对法案进行了数十处的修改。除了正文1000多页，法案还有42页的修正案内容。</p>
<p>如此临“闯关”前的多处改动突出表明，团结共和党内各派力量支持法案有多难。</p>

<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="616410e1">法案内容：减税、SALT、提高债务上限、撤销拜登政府清洁能源税收抵免</h2>
</div>
<p>上述议案名为“大漂亮”法案（One Big Beautiful Bill Act），包含众多重要内容，主要聚焦于：</p>
<ul>
<li>延长2017年特朗普第一个总统任期出台的企业和个人减税措施，这些措施原定于今年12月31日到期；</li>
<li>将SALT（州和地方税）扣除上限从1万美元提高至4万美元；</li>
<li>暂时对小费、汽车贷款等提供新的税收减免；</li>
<li>限制食品券计划和医疗补助等安全网计划；</li>
<li>投入1500亿美元增加军费支出、投入1750亿美元用于移民执法；</li>
<li>提高4万亿美元的债务上限，防止财政部可能在今年8月或9月出现违约；</li>
<li>加速取消民主党拜登政府推动的清洁能源税收抵免；</li>
<li>为2026年底开始实施医疗补助工作要求。</li>
</ul>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="826d930f">参议院前景：共和党参议员承诺将大幅修改法案</h2>
</div>
<p>尽管法案在众议院取得突破，但前往参议院的道路并不平坦。</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3744997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻</a>此前提到，减税案进入参议院投票可以走“快车道”，因为共和党人上月解锁了&#34;预算协调&#34;机制。</p>
<p>该机制允许共和党人绕过参议院的&#34;冗长辩论&#34;(filibuster)规则，共和党可以在没有民主党议员支持的情况下，仅以简单多数票就通过特朗普的法案，无需通常在参议院推动法案所需的60票。</p>
<p>不过，就算是要凑齐简单多数票，参议院的共和党领袖也得先把内部口径统一起来。媒体指出，多位共和党参议员已表示，他们将要求对该法案进行重大修改，然后才会同意投票支持。</p>
<p>密苏里州的共和党参议员Josh Hawley等保守派人士已警告，如果法案削减医疗补助项目下的健康福利，他们将反对任何一揽子计划。</p>
<p>民主党人之前就抨击法案。参议院民主党领袖舒默（Chuck Schumer）发布声明称：&#34;这不是一个漂亮的大法案。它很丑陋。&#34;</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="74a0c2bd">赢家与输家：谁从法案中受益最多？</h2>
</div>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h3><strong>赢家</strong>：</h3>
</div>
<p>特朗普 - 这项法案包含了他的主要竞选承诺，包括延长税收减免、加强移民管控和促进国内能源生产。更重要的是，法案表明特朗普对众议院共和党内部最保守派系保持了强大影响力。</p>
<p>众议院议长约翰逊 - 一开始外界怀疑他能否在下周一阵亡将士纪念日前让众议员们通过法案，凭借这次险胜，约翰逊展示了他团结各派共和党人的能力。</p>
<p>SALT减税支持者 - 来自高税收民主党蓝州的温和共和党人成功确保了SALT扣除上限的显著提高，从目前的10,000美元增加到40,000美元，对收入低于500,000美元的人有效。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h3><strong>输家</strong>：</h3>
</div>
<p>赤字鹰派人士 - 尽管保守派支出鹰派人士曾警告他们不会支持增加赤字支出的法案，但他们最终妥协了。该法案预计在未来十年将增加数万亿美元的赤字。</p>
<p>气候变化议题 - 法案包括大幅削减拜登政府的绿色能源议程，削减了旨在减少污染的联邦计划，并取消了电动汽车的税收抵免。</p>
<p>医疗补助受益人 - 根据国会预算办公室的数据，新的医疗补助资格限制预计将导致未来十年超过700万人失去保险。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="fdb36a">两党的政治计算：民主党警告支持法案就会失去中期选举选票</h2>
</div>
<p>民主党人承诺，要让共和党在明年的中期选举中为此付出代价，他们将这项法案描述为&#34;劫贫济富&#34;。</p>
<p>众议院少数党民主党的领袖Hakeem Jeffries警告：&#34;共和党的税收骗局将最严重地伤害工薪家庭，同时为像Elon Musk这样的亿万富翁提供大规模的减税。&#34;</p>
<p>美国民主党全国委员会（DNC）的主席Ken Martin更直接地表示：&#34;民主党人将竭尽所能将那些对这项法案负责的人赶出办公室。这次投票将使许多共和党人在中期选举中失去席位。&#34;</p>
<p>共和党人则反驳称，他们的选民会因实现特朗普今年的首要立法优先事项而受到鼓舞，并给予政治回报。</p>
<p>美国共和党全国委员会（RNC）的发言人Mike Marinella断言：&#34;众议院民主党人刚刚签署了自己的政治死亡令。选民不会忘记他们是如何背叛工薪家庭的。&#34;</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="d83da4e8">债务增加引发市场忧虑</h2>
</div>
<p>受法案税收减免驱动的赤字也可能加剧债券投资者对美国债务不断膨胀的担忧，这在上上周五穆迪下调美国主权信用评级的行动中已经有所体现。</p>
<p>新近数据显示，美国国债规模已攀升至36.2万亿美元。根据国会预算办公室周二的预测，减税法案将使美国公债再增加2.3万亿美元。总体而言，到2033年，该法案将使最低收入阶层的家庭资源减少4%，使最高收入阶层的家庭资源增加2%。</p>
<p>美国联邦预算问责委员会对这项法案深表担忧。该机构的声明称，众议院的预算框架是“对财政责任的公然蔑视”，该法案不仅将令国债激增3万亿美元以上，还埋下大规模减税与支出政策到期形成的“财政悬崖”隐患，即如果延续这些政策，可能将再度耗费数万亿美元。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，投资者密切关注着这一发展对长期财政健康的影响，这或许解释了为何主要美股指会在投票通过前下跌。</p>
<p>随着这项法案被送往参议院，所有目光都将聚焦于共和党内不同派系之间的谈判，以及他们能否在7月4日前将最终版本送达特朗普的办公桌。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  苹果加码AI布局！计划2026年推智能眼镜，停止开发摄像头手表 
Description:  <p data-start="0" data-end="65">媒体报道，苹果公司计划在明年年底推出智能眼镜，但该公司目前已暂停开发配备内置摄像头、可分析周围环境的智能手表项目。</p>
<h2 data-start="0" data-end="65">将与Meta眼镜竞争，目标2026年推出</h2>
<p data-start="67" data-end="200">知情人士对媒体透露，苹果工程师正加快推进这款智能眼镜的研发，目标是在2026年年底前推出，这款产品将与Meta公司广受欢迎的Ray-Ban智能眼镜竞争。消息人士对媒体称，苹果将在今年年底开始与海外供应商合作，大规模生产原型机。</p>
<p data-start="329" data-end="463"><strong>根据媒体，苹果的智能眼镜将配备摄像头、麦克风和扬声器，能够分析外部世界，并通过Siri语音助手接收用户指令。</strong>眼镜还可以完成打电话、播放音乐、实时翻译和导航等任务。整体功能将类似于Meta目前的眼镜产品和运行Alphabet旗下Android XR操作系统的即将发布的设备。</p>
<p data-start="465" data-end="533">消息传出后，苹果股价周四下午曾短暂上涨，但最终收跌0.36%，报201.36美元。今年截至周三收盘，苹果股价已累计下跌19%。</p>
<p data-start="465" data-end="533"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/859ac436-710e-41a6-8595-e41b8e4911fa.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="626" data-wscnw="702" data-wscnsize="86588"/></p>
<p data-start="535" data-end="594">媒体称，这款眼镜最初在内部代号为N50，现在被归入更广泛的项目名称N401。不过，苹果的计划仍可能发生变化，过去也曾取消过多个项目。</p>
<p data-start="596" data-end="663">苹果的终极目标是推出一款增强现实眼镜，可以通过显示屏和其他技术，在真实世界的视野中叠加数字内容。但这一目标至少还需要几年时间才能实现。</p>
<p data-start="741" data-end="889">一位知情人士对媒体表示，这款智能眼镜将在功能上与Meta的产品相似，但品质更优。Meta推出的智能眼镜越来越受消费者欢迎，公司还计划在今年晚些时候推出更高端的版本。这款高端眼镜将配备显示屏，用户可以查看通知、照片和其他相对简单的图像。</p>
<h2 data-start="741" data-end="889">配备摄像头的Apple Watch项目被叫停</h2>
<p data-start="891" data-end="947">苹果也曾尝试打造突破性的AI产品，包括考虑为其智能手表和AirPods耳机配备摄像头，以获取更多周边环境的信息。</p>
<p data-start="949" data-end="1043"><strong>消息人士对媒体称，苹果原本积极推进在2027年前发布配备摄像头的Apple Watch和Apple Watch Ultra，但该项目本周已被叫停。不过，公司仍在继续研发带摄像头的AirPods。</strong></p>
<p data-start="1045" data-end="1123"><strong>分析认为，打造一款完美的AI设备，将是一场高风险的竞争。</strong>苹果在为iPhone、iPad和Mac添加有吸引力的AI功能方面进展缓慢，现在面临着错失整个新产品类别的风险。</p>

Title:  谷歌反垄断又“摊上事儿”了！与Character.AI合作协议遭审查 
Description:  <p>Alphabet旗下谷歌公司在AI技术上面临美国司法部的反垄断调查。周四，据媒体报道，<strong>美国司法部正在调查谷歌是否因与聊天机器人公司Character.AI的AI技术合作协议而违反了反垄断法。</strong></p>
<p data-start="82" data-end="213">反垄断执法人员近期已通知谷歌，他们正在审查其与Character.AI公司的协议是否被有意设计成避开政府正式的合并审查流程。在与谷歌去年达成的交易中，Character.AI的创始人加入了谷歌，同时谷歌获得了该公司技术的非独家使用许可。</p>
<p data-start="215" data-end="303">像谷歌这类的交易在硅谷被视为一种高效方式，便于公司引入新项目所需的技术人才。然而，这种做法也引起了监管机构的警觉，他们担心成熟的大型科技公司可能借此手段打压新兴创新者的竞争力。</p>
<p data-start="215" data-end="303">即便相关交易不需要正式审查，美国司法部仍可评估其是否具有反竞争性质。目前谷歌尚未在本次反垄断调查中被指控存在不当行为，该调查仍处于早期阶段，未必最终会导致执法行动。</p>
<p data-start="305" data-end="422">谷歌发言人Peter Schottenfels在一封电子邮件声明中表示：“我们始终乐于回答监管机构的任何问题。我们很高兴Character.AI的人才加入了谷歌，但我们没有持有该公司的股份，他们仍是一家独立公司。”</p>
<p data-start="305" data-end="422">美国司法部发言人拒绝置评。Character.AI方面的代表也未回应媒体置评请求。</p>
<p data-start="650" data-end="736">Character.AI因其可以模拟任何人物或事物的聊天机器人而知名。其创始人曾在谷歌工作，几年前离职创办了这家公司。去年与谷歌的交易达成后，他们与部分研究团队成员重新回到谷歌。</p>
<p data-start="738" data-end="860" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">据媒体此前报道，根据与谷歌的交易，Character.AI的现有投资者将以相当于公司25亿美元估值的价格被买回股份。作为协议的一部分，该初创公司与谷歌签订了大语言模型技术的非独家许可协议。同时，Character.AI仍以独立公司身份运营。</p>
<h2 data-start="738" data-end="860">谷歌面临巨大的反垄断监管压力</h2>
<p data-start="18" data-end="76">早自拜登政府时期，美国执法机构就开始对快速发展的AI生态系统中的竞争问题展开审查，包括专用芯片和计算资源的供应。美国政府关注的一个重点是：大型科技公司是否通过与AI初创企业的合作关系，在技术发展过程中获得不公平的优势。</p>
<p data-start="18" data-end="76">在美国联邦法院裁定谷歌在在线搜索和广告技术市场存在非法垄断行为之后，美国司法部的民事调查正在加大对谷歌的反垄断审查力度。</p>
<p data-start="78" data-end="126">在在线搜索案件中，美国司法部提议强制谷歌剥离其Chrome浏览器，以恢复搜索市场的竞争环境。</p>
<p data-start="128" data-end="235" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">作为该案件的一部分，美国政府还敦促法官禁止谷歌为搜索引擎默认设置付费，人工智能产品也包括在其中，<strong>并要求执法机构有权审查谷歌与AI相关的任何收购行为，即便这些交易未达到正式审查的门槛。</strong>该案件的裁决预计将在今年夏季作出。</p>
<h2 data-start="128" data-end="235">谷歌周四冲高回落</h2>
<p data-start="128" data-end="235" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">谷歌今年以来股价下跌近10%，表现大幅不及美股大盘。周四，谷歌盘中一度涨近5%，此后股价涨幅大幅收窄，收涨近1.4%，不过当日表现仍强于美股大盘。</p>
<p>本周，谷歌举行了2025年开发者大会。摩根大通大赞谷歌，称其AI技术领先，远超此前的创新速度，“AI重塑搜索”已成型，货币化也已考虑。摩根大通指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>谷歌正以前所未有的速度发布产品，全栈AI策略使其基础模型在效率与成本方面更具优势。谷歌搜索引擎AI Mode是“自搜索引擎发明以来的最大革命”，此外，谷歌正计划通过Gemini、Gemma等模型将AI技术商业化。</p>

Title:  特朗普打压美国高校，寒蝉效应来袭！MIT将缩招、裁员，哥大申请人数大降 
Description:  <p>周四，据媒体报道，特朗普政府于周四中止了哈佛大学招收国际学生的资格，特朗普政府通知哈佛大学，禁止其招收国际学生。同时，白宫打压美国学界带来的的寒蝉效应已经扩及其他知名学府，麻省理工学院已决定削减招生人数并裁员，哥伦比亚大学也因为去年开始的反以色列示威而遭到特朗普政府的“重点关照”，申请人数大幅减少。</p>
<h2>麻省理工：缩减研究生项目招生、裁员</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="77"><strong>媒体报道，由于特朗普政府对高校的财政挤压使其前景不明，麻省理工学院（MIT）正面临日益严峻的财务挑战，该校此前表示，正在减少其著名研究项目的研究生招生人数，并裁减部分员工。</strong></p>
<p data-start="79" data-end="182">此前，美国总统特朗普削减了通过国家卫生研究院（NIH）等联邦机构提供的拨款和补偿，而这些机构一直是以研究为导向的大学如MIT的重要资金来源。此外，按照已在美国众议院通过的立法，MIT的捐赠基金还将面临大幅加税。</p>
<p data-start="184" data-end="300">目前，MIT已经采取措施削减开支，包括冻结招聘。现在，为应对联邦科研拨款的可能减少，该校计划在2025学年减少约100名研究型研究生的招生人数，较刚结束的这个学年下降8%，MIT发言人Kimberly Allen周三表示。此前，MIT已宣布计划在下一个学年将中央预算拨付给各学术与行政部门的金额削减最多10%。这一举措迫使一些部门不得不裁员。她未透露具体裁员人数。那些收入来源主要依赖中央预算、几乎没有外部资金支持的行政部门受到的影响最大。</p>
<p data-start="184" data-end="300">MIT校长Sally Kornbluth本周在一份声明中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="302" data-end="417">“未来几个月，麻省理工以及全美高校，甚至整个美国科研体系，可能还将面临更大的冲击，虽然我们将竭尽全力避免这种情况，但也必须为各种结果做好准备。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="696" data-end="754">同时，尽管MIT拥有近250亿美元的捐赠基金，但其中大部分资金都有指定用途，例如学生资助，不能被灵活用于填补其他资金缺口。而根据共和党的税收提案，学生人数超过500人、且人均捐赠基金超过200万美元的私立大学和学院，其净投资收益将被征收21%的税率，远高于目前1.4%的水平。Kornbluth斯表示，这将是“毁灭性的税负”，每年将使MIT损失数亿美元的用于科研和学生资助的资金。</p>
<h2 data-start="996" data-end="1057">哥大：特朗普的重点打击目标，申请人数大幅减少</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="72">据媒体报道，升学咨询公司AtomicMind发现该公司申请克伦比亚大学的客户人数大幅减少。该公司负责人Leelila Strogov表示，这主要因为家长担忧去年以来哥大出现的反以色列示威而引发的校园动荡。同时，有超过20位学生、教授及升学顾问在接受媒体采访时透露，哥伦比亚大学在过去两年持续动荡之后，声誉已经严重受损。</p>
<p data-start="213" data-end="317">自2023年10月哈马斯袭击以色列事件后，该校校园氛围日益紧张，校方难以应对当下笼罩高等教育界的文化战争。与此同时，哥大也成为特朗普政府攻击精英高校的核心目标之一，总统指责该校在亲巴抗议潮中未能保护犹太学生。</p>
<p data-start="213" data-end="317"><strong>截至目前，哥伦比亚大学已损失约4亿美元联邦科研资金，原因正是特朗普政府重点打击常春藤高校。同时，在共和党主导的支出计划下，该校还面临约150亿美元捐赠基金的巨额税收。</strong></p>
<p data-start="319" data-end="359">随着外界对该校观感恶化，多家升学咨询机构的负责人直言不讳地指出了哥大所受的冲击。</p>
<p data-start="361" data-end="494">佛州的Mandee Heller Adler表示，今年她服务的学生中，申请哥大的人数显著下降，从两年前的52人减至38人。在新泽西州Short Hills，升学辅导公司Summit Prep联合创始人David Blobaum则表示，他目前正在帮助两位学生办理转学。</p>
<p data-start="496" data-end="623">Top Tier Admissions总裁Elizabeth Stone说，有一位学生因担心联邦科研经费不稳定，选择了杜克大学而非哥大；纽约Command Education创始人Chris Rim表示，他的多位学生尽管被哥大录取，最终却选择了其他学校。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title:  美国5月Markit制造业和服务业PMI均超预期且扩张，价格指数再涨 
Description:  <p>5月22日周四，标普全球公布的数据显示，美国5月Markit制造业、服务业、综合PMI初值均好于预期，且录得扩张。由于与贸易相关的担忧有所缓解，即便关税导致的价格压力持续上升，美国本月的商业活动和产出预期均有所改善，制造业和服务业呈现同步增长的态势。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/6264a531-d41b-43f8-b733-add4a1009224.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="651" data-wscnw="1090" data-wscnsize="84873"/></p>
<h2>美国5月Markit PMI初值</h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #1482f0;">美国5月Markit PMI初值数据如下，50为荣枯分水岭。</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>美国5月Markit制造业PMI初值52.3，创今年2月以来的三个月新高，预期49.9，前值50.2：</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>这是该数据连续第五个月高于50荣枯线。</p>
<p>其中，新订单增速创下一年多以来的最快水平。新订单分项指数初值上升至53.3，创2024年2月份以来新高，连续五个月扩张。</p>
<p>企业对未来产出的预期也升至2月以来的最高水平。</p>
<p>尽管大幅改善，美国制造业PMI数据仍显示出不确定性挥之不去，同时也反映出生产商如何应对成本上升的压力。出口订单连续第二个月萎缩，就业数据也出现下降。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>美国5月Markit服务业PMI初值52.3，创下两个月新高，预期51，前值50.8：</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>本月服务业整体活动的增长得益于新业务的回暖。与制造业类似，服务业的出口订单同样走弱，该指标录得自2020年疫情封锁以来的最大萎缩。</p>
<p>价格收取分项指数初值创2023年4月份以来新高。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>美国5月Markit综合PMI初值52.1，预期50.3，前值50.6：</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>此前一个月的综合PMI数据曾下滑至2023年以来的最低点。</p>
<p>尽管5月数据回升，就业分项指数初值降至49.5，创2月份以来新低、并逆转之前的扩张趋势。</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457">最新的Markit PMI数据显示，活动和市场情绪出现可喜的企稳，与此同时，企业在将进口商品和材料关税上涨的成本转嫁给消费者方面也取得了成功：综合销售价格指数连续第三个月加速上涨，达到2022年8月以来的最高水平。</p>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/34e83992-5fa9-4dee-95be-81ec2b25b6c8.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="392" data-wscnw="638" data-wscnsize="30698"/></p>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457"> </p>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457">此外，PMI数据的反弹也反映出市场对供应短缺的担忧，这促使许多制造商开始增加库存。制造商的原材料及其他投入品库存指数飙升至2007年有调查数据以来的最高水平。</p>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457">本次Markit PMI调查数据的采集时间为5月12日至21日。</p>
<h2 data-start="340" data-end="457">分析点评</h2>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457">标普全球市场情报的首席商业经济学家Chris Williamson在声明中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="340" data-end="457">与4月令人担忧的下滑相比，5月的商业信心有所改善，企业对未来一年前景的悲观情绪有所缓解，这在很大程度上要归功于暂停加征关税的决定。</p>
<p data-start="556" data-end="635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">5月经济反弹的部分原因，可能是企业及其客户试图抢在未来可能的关税问题前采取行动，尤其是在7月90天暂停期结束后可能面临进一步加税的背景下。</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="556" data-end="635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">财经金融博客Zerohedge点评称，此前一系列软数据，如美国地区联储的调查和私营部门的情绪指标一直在“高声唱衰”，但“硬数据”却始终表现良好。周四最重要的一项“软数据”PMI调查终于“投降”，大幅反弹，美国制造业和服务业PMI双双超出预期上升。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  美国4月成屋销售创2009年以来同期最差，库存同比大涨，房价再新高 
Description:  <p>美国4月二手房销量下滑，降至过去7个月来的最低水平。</p>
<p data-start="108" data-end="187">5月22日，美国全国房地产经纪人协会（NAR）公布数据显示，<strong data-start="137" data-end="187">美国4月成屋销售环比下滑0.5%，远低于预期的环比增长2%。不经季节调整的话，4月二手房销量比去年同期下滑了3.1%。</strong></p>
<p data-start="108" data-end="187"><strong data-start="137" data-end="187">年化销售总数仅400万套，创下2009年金融危机以来最差的4月表现，低于预期的410万户和前值的402万户。</strong></p>
<p data-start="108" data-end="187"><strong data-start="137" data-end="187"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/d31d7604-2934-4be5-a303-fa41149e57b3.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="645" data-wscnw="1090" data-wscnsize="83444"/></strong></p>
<p data-start="189" data-end="235">这本该是春季卖房旺季，却开局冷清。NAR首席经济学家Lawrence Yun表示：</p>
<blockquote data-start="236" data-end="292">
<p data-start="238" data-end="292">“被压抑的住房需求在增加，但始终没能释放出来。”</p>
<p data-start="238" data-end="292">“只有房贷利率真正下降，才可能带动这波需求入场。”</p>
<p data-start="238" data-end="292"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/29c25482-23da-41da-83d4-0ded4510f663.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="654" data-wscnw="1090"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="321" data-end="355">4月购房市场之所以低迷，最核心的原因是房贷利率又涨了，买房负担不起。上周30年期房贷利率升至6.92%，创下近三个月新高，而且还在继续往上走，背后原因是美债收益率大涨（市场担心美国财政赤字），而房贷利率和国债收益率是联动的。</p>
<p data-start="440" data-end="469">在利率高、房价也不便宜的情况下，买房变得更加负担不起。来自密歇根大学的调查显示，美国人的整体消费情绪接近历史最低，觉得现在是买房好时机的人也创下历史新低。</p>
<p data-start="627" data-end="645">按理说，4月上市的房源是明显变多的，二手房总库存同比增长21%，达到145万套，是自2020年以来最多的4月库存。但销量并没有跟着提升，说明买方市场需求依然低迷，更令人失望的是，NAR表示将下调全年二手房销售预期。</p>
<p data-start="627" data-end="645">此外，即使房子多了，房价也没降。全美4月二手房中位售价为41.4万美元，同比上涨1.8%，创4月同期历史新高，但这是自2023年年中以来最小的涨幅，主要是因为高价房的成交增加了。美国楼市大部分是二手房交易（成交时才算入统计），而政府将在本周五公布新房销售数据。</p>
<p data-start="54" data-end="128">从地区来看，中西部的二手房销量有所回升，西部和东北地区则继续下滑，南方市场则基本持平。房型方面，独栋住宅销量小幅下滑，而公寓跌幅更大。</p>
<p data-start="130" data-end="212">虽然整体市场偏冷，但流通速度略有提升，4月有60%的房子在上市不到一个月内就成交，高于3月的57%。其中，18%的房子以高于挂牌价成交，说明部分热盘仍然供不应求。</p>
<p data-start="214" data-end="310">从买家结构看，投资客和度假买家占比为15%，与上月持平；25%的交易为全款支付，不贷款。而首套房买家占比达到34%，是自2020年7月以来的最高水平。</p>
<p data-start="108" data-end="187"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/275f0766-bc4b-4b7b-93fe-5419909448b8.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="254" data-wscnw="897"/></p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  苹果、特斯拉、英伟达等热门股将在Kraken交易平台上以代币形式交易 
Description:  <p>周四，据媒体报道，苹果、特斯拉、英伟达等热门美股将在加密货币交易平台Kraken上以代币形式交易。Kraken计划允许非美国客户交易苹果等股票，这个新计划将在未来几周内启动。</p>
<p>Kraken公司计划推出超过50只股票和ETF的代币化版本。计划代币化的ETF包括知名的SPDR标普500 ETF和SPDR黄金ETF等。Kraken将这类代币称为“xStocks”，并将在Solana区块链上运行。区块链是一种记录加密交易的去中心化账本。</p>
<p>xStocks代币将由对应基础证券的实际股票作为支持，由Kraken的合作伙伴公司Backed Finance视需要购买新股票。这些代币可按基础证券的现金价值进行赎回。理论上来说，代币价格应该与相应股票或是ETF的市场价格保持一致。</p>
<p>与比特币类似，这些代币可以全天候交易——即使在美国股市休市期间也能买卖。</p>
<p data-start="283" data-end="333">Kraken总部位于美国，客户遍布190多个国家。Kraken表示，这类所谓的“股票代币化”产品，将使非美国投资者更容易投资美股。代币化股票将在欧洲、拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲上线；美国用户将无法交易这些代币。</p>
<h2 data-start="564" data-end="582">为什么要把股票放到区块链上？</h2>
<p data-start="584" data-end="652">除了提供7天24小时交易的优势外，Kraken还表示，这种代币化股票为国际投资者提供了更便宜、更简便的方式进入美股市场。</p>
<p data-start="654" data-end="725">Kraken联合首席执行官Arjun Sethi表示：“海外投资者现在也可以通过本地券商购买美股，但通常手续费高、结算时间慢，存在很多摩擦。”</p>
<p data-start="727" data-end="796"><strong>未来，xStocks的投资者甚至可以在Kraken之外的加密交易所交易这些代币，并可将其转入到个人加密钱包中，与比特币等其他资产一起持有。</strong>风险偏好高的投资者甚至还可以将这些代币化的苹果、特斯拉等股票作为抵押品，用于其加密货币交易策略。</p>
<h2 data-start="847" data-end="863">代币化股票以前也尝试过</h2>
<p data-start="865" data-end="943">全球最大加密交易所Binance曾在2021年推出特斯拉等美股的代币化产品，但几个月后被迫下架，因为全球多国监管机构警告Binance未持有相应牌照。</p>
<p data-start="945" data-end="1014">同样，Kraken也必须应对各国复杂的监管环境，以确保xStocks合法发行。Kraken发言人表示，公司“正在积极与多个监管机构合作”。</p>
<p data-start="1016" data-end="1177" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">区块链支持者们多年来一直主张，代币化能在结算速度、成本、灵活性等方面优于传统证券交易方式。随着特朗普政府和美国国会推进加密交易新规，这一议题近几个月来再度升温。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）本月已召开关于证券代币化的圆桌会议，华尔街知名公司如贝莱德和Robinhood等，也在积极推动此类产品的发展。</p>

Title:  欧洲央行：四月降息实为“六月提前行动”，通胀接近目标但关税隐忧仍在 
Description:  <p>部分欧洲央行官员认为，今年四月的借贷成本下调，<strong>实际上是将原定于六月进行的降息行动“提前”了。</strong></p>
<p>根据欧洲央行的会议纪要，这些官员认为，“近期事件使他们确信，在当前会议上降息，为应对负面结果提供了某种保障，并避免在金融市场波动时期增加额外的不确定性。”</p>
<p>会议纪要于本周四公布。官员们认为，欧元区通胀“接近尾声”，但贸易紧张短期内或抑制物价。</p>
<p>市场目前预计，欧洲央行下月降息的可能性约为90%，并预计今年还将有一次降息，届时欧洲央行的存款利率将触底至1.75%。</p>
<h2>欧洲央行四月降息被视为六月行动的“前置”</h2>
<p>上月，欧洲央行进行了年内的第七次降息，并警告称美国关税将对经济增长造成重大打击，这进一步强化了市场对未来几个月更多宽松政策的预期。</p>
<p>会议纪要其中提到：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“本次会议的降息可以被视为将六月会议可能进行的降息行动提前，这突显了在未来会议中保留充分选择权的重要性。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>目前看来，由于美国关税对经济增长的压力以及欧元走强，欧洲央行有望在未来两周内再次降息。欧元走强和海外商品可能转向欧洲市场，也意味着通胀可能会比预期更早地降至2%的目标。</p>
<p><strong>市场预计,欧洲央行下月降息的可能性约为90%，并预计今年还将有一次降息，</strong>届时欧洲央行的存款利率将触底至1.75%。这一水平与欧洲央行估计的中性利率区间下限相符，即既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的水平。</p>
<p>比利时央行行长皮埃尔·温施（Pierre Wunsch）本周表示，<strong>这种预期是“合理的”</strong>，因为货币政策可能需要变得“温和支持性”，以避免通胀放缓至目标以下。</p>
<h2>欧元区通胀“接近尾声”，贸易紧张短期内或抑制物价</h2>
<p>欧洲央行决策者还认为，<strong>欧元区通胀已“接近尾声”，</strong>尽管长期来看贸易冲突可能导致通胀，但短期内贸易紧张局势可能会对物价构成压力。</p>
<p>欧洲央行在会议纪要中表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“（管委会）成员们对通胀将在中期内回归目标表达了更高的信心，并且认为对抗通胀冲击的斗争已接近尾声。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>会议纪要指出，<strong>“因此，短期内通缩力量可能会占据主导地位。”</strong></p>
<p>然而，一些决策者认为，从长远来看，关税将是通胀的根源。会议纪要补充道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“这些成员认为，考虑到全球价值链断裂的破坏性影响，贸易冲击在短期之外引发通胀的可能性更高。”</p>

Title:  特朗普扩大赤字，美元比美债压力更大 
Description:  <p>德银警告，美国财政风险持续下，美债能撑住，美元撑不住。</p>
<p>据追风交易台消息，5月21日，德银发布研报指出，美元当前面临的最大威胁，可能不是别的，而是美国政府自身的财政状况。目前美国财政“不确定性指数”飙到历史新高，源头是税改、赤字争议不断。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f7c07f63-67bf-4b36-b9be-0c16bc959b9b.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="369" data-wscnw="480"/></p>
<p>因此，投资者对美债兴趣减弱，30年期和20年期美债收益率双双突破5%，本应更具吸引力，但最新20年期国债的拍卖结果却表现不佳，显示海外资金正在悄然撤离。美债未来可能需要美国本土机构来接盘。</p>
<p>即使美国机构接手美债，也无法抵消外资撤出对美元的打击。因为本土机构没有那么多海外资产可以“卖了换美元”来对冲这个空缺，外汇流出是实打实的。</p>
<h2>外资撤离，美债或稳，汇率难保</h2>
<p>德银指出，美国“财政政策不确定性指数”已飙升至历史新高，主要源于围绕税改、财政赤字与长期预算前景的持续争议。而更糟的是，在经济状况并不差的背景下，美国的财政赤字却异常巨大、且难以持续。</p>
<p>按照过去几十年的规律，财政赤字的规模应该和失业率高度相关，失业高、政府才多花钱救市，但现在的失业率这么低，照理说预算应该接近平衡才对，结果赤字反而还在加速膨胀。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/771410ef-bfd6-4443-91b4-5249c1b97e38.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="370" data-wscnw="479"/></p>
<p>德银表示，财政疑云下，投资者对美债兴趣正在减弱。美债收益率持续上涨，30年期和20年期国债利率都已经突破5%，而且最新的20年期美债拍卖结果也表现不佳。德银认为，这可能是过去长期买美债的海外资金，正在悄悄撤离。</p>
<p>长期以来，外国投资者一直是美债的主力买家。如果这一退潮持续，谁来接盘将成为关键问题。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/aba31bb9-9a76-442a-ad8b-4e4d2f73529d.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="383" data-wscnw="477"/></p>
<p>德银认为，美国本土机构或许会在高收益率的驱动下出手接盘，虽然相比几十年前，他们现在在美债市场的持仓占比已经大幅下降。而且，他们不像海外投资者那样对美国财政赤字那么敏感和紧张。尤其如果未来SLR（补充杠杆率）政策出现调整，银行可能加大买入美债力度。</p>
<p>然而，就算美国本土投资者接盘了美债，也无法阻止美元走弱。原因在于美国本土机构没有足够的海外资产可以“卖了换美元”来填补流出缺口。数据显示，外国投资者持有的美债规模是美国机构持有海外债券的4倍，资金结构极不对称。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/441e5945-7481-4ac8-a8b2-40b4c4d3c7f8.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="383" data-wscnw="480"/></p>
<p>更现实的是，美国本土机构现在在股市的持仓已经处于历史高位，若它们真要加大对美债的配置，可能得先砍股市仓位，这会带来连锁效应。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/c78b5d35-a5a5-4873-9a9e-2dab0c4bd597.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="388" data-wscnw="480"/></p>
<p data-start="277" data-end="286">总之，即使未来美国本土机构愿意从股市撤资、去买更多美债，也可能帮美债找到支撑，但由于外国投资者的持续撤出，对美元仍是明显的利空因素。</p>

Title:  大摩分析师：关于特斯拉，这是马斯克最重要的一句话，跟小米YU 7有关 
Description:  <p>继本周“誓死捍卫”特斯拉之后，马斯克的又一句话透露出公司未来发展的关键信息。</p>
<p>近期，马斯克在接受CNBC访谈时明确表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#34;从长期来看，唯一重要的是自动驾驶和Optimus。&#34;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>然而，摩根士丹利最新发布的报告却揭示了一个可能改变游戏规则的新对手——小米YU7。</p>
<p>据追风交易台消息，摩根士丹利21日发布研报表示，如果观察小米YU7的设计和规格，将对特斯拉非常有启发性。<strong>小米YU7外观像法拉利或阿斯顿马丁SUV，价格却与丰田凯美瑞相当。</strong></p>
<p>YU7的出现不仅为消费者提供了更多的选择，也给特斯拉带来了前所未有的压力。这引发一个关键问题：<strong>特斯拉是否应该继续推出更多传统方向盘式电动车，还是应该专注于自动驾驶和机器人等前沿技术领域？</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/a3c64180-111f-4bf1-b47d-eddc6f885c90.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="713" data-wscnw="1268"/></p>
<h2>40天内推出无监督Robotaxi！奥斯汀先行，扩张在即</h2>
<p>摩根士丹利指出，马斯克在采访中确认，<strong>将在40天内在德克萨斯州奥斯汀推出完全自动驾驶的Cybercab，称&#34;我们有数千辆正在测试的汽车&#34;。</strong></p>
<p>虽然初期部署规模很小（第一周仅10辆车），但马斯克预计&#34;几个月内可能达到1000辆&#34;，<strong>随后将扩展到旧金山、洛杉矶和圣安东尼奥等城市。</strong></p>
<p>这符合摩根士丹利的预期，即特斯拉将优先在德克萨斯、内华达、加利福尼亚和佛罗里达等&#34;特斯拉友好州&#34;部署服务，最终形成连接城市中心、机场和城市间的高容量枢纽网络。这种“枢纽-辐射”网络模式具有巨大的潜力。</p>
<h2>联邦标准的重要性与“视觉优先”策略</h2>
<p>马斯克强调了美国在自动驾驶领域面临的一个主要劣势——<strong>缺乏联邦自动驾驶标准。</strong>他表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;为自动驾驶汽车制定统一的国家法规将非常重要。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>报告提到，特斯拉可能会向其他主要汽车制造商开放FSD授权。 尽管摩根士丹利团队对FSD授权的预期不如几年前那么重要，但这仍然是一个值得关注的潜在合作机会。</p>
<p>此外，特斯拉坚持“视觉优先”的自动驾驶技术路线，马斯克认为，多传感器系统容易产生混淆，进而导致事故：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;我们发现，当有多个传感器时，它们往往会相互混淆。所以你是相信摄像头还是相信激光雷达？如果你感到困惑...这就是可能导致事故的原因。&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>特斯拉面临新挑战，小米YU7性价比凸显</h2>
<p>特斯拉在电动汽车市场的竞争格局中正面临新的挑战。报告中提到，小米推出的YU7车型凭借其出色的性价比，正在成为市场上的有力竞争者。</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“它外观像法拉利或阿斯顿马丁SUV，价格却与丰田凯美瑞相当。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>摩根士丹利认为，面对小米YU7这样的竞争对手，特斯拉如果继续坚持推出更多传统带有方向盘的电动汽车，可能会在市场竞争中处于不利地位。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“问问自己，特斯拉是否更适合推出更多带有方向盘的电动汽车。”</p>
</blockquote>

Title:  欧元区5月PMI意外萎缩，服务业创16个月来最差表现 
Description:  <p>欧元区经济在5月意外萎缩，服务业表现跌至16个月以来最差水平，制造业的小幅改善被服务业的下跌所抵消。</p>
<p>22日，S&amp;P Global发布的采购经理人指数（PMI）显示：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>欧元区综合PMI指数从4月的50.4降至49.5，低于分析师此前预测的50.6；</li>
<li>服务业PMI初值48.9，低于预期的50.5和前值50.1；</li>
<li>制造业PMI初值49.4，预期值49.2，前值49。</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/246ba76a-c734-45dd-b7a2-6dceed5c554c.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="506" data-wscnw="1577"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>法国的经济活动已连续9个月萎缩，综合PMI仅从4月份的47.8小幅上升至48，依旧远低于50的门槛。德法服务业活动均出现下跌。</p>
<p>数据发布后，货币市场加大了对欧洲央行今年将再降息两次的押注。对政策敏感的德国两年期国债收益率下跌3个基点至1.84%。欧元兑美元汇率扩大跌幅，一度下跌0.3%至1.1296美元。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/69febf46-74a7-4873-ab9e-27b9be6f0d82.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1071" data-wscnw="1577"/></p>
<h2>欧元区私营部门活动意外收缩，服务业表现疲软是主要拖累</h2>
<p>根据S&amp;P Global的数据显示，欧元区5月私营部门活动意外萎缩。汉堡商业银行的经济学家Cyrus de la Rubia表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“欧元区经济似乎难以站稳脚跟。”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>他指出，虽然服务业的国外需求有所放缓，<strong>但国内需求的疲软才是拖累该行业的主要原因。</strong>服务业的疲软表现是导致整体PMI下降的关键因素，这预示着欧元区经济复苏的道路将更加艰难。</p>
<p>5月份欧元区制造业的表现好于服务业，这是自疫情爆发以来首次出现的情况。De la Rubia认为，这可能与应对美国贸易关税的措施有关，而较低的油价也可能对此有所帮助。欧元区制造业已连续三个月增加产量，新订单自2022年4月以来首次没有下降。</p>
<h2>法国持续萎缩、德国面临服务业的寒冬</h2>
<p>虽然整体数据不佳，但欧元区内部各国表现却有所分化。</p>
<p><strong>法国的经济活动已连续9个月萎缩，综合PMI仅从4月份的47.8小幅上升至48，依旧远低于50的门槛。</strong>汉堡商业银行的经济学家Jonas Feldhusen表示，这些数据反映了法国在“国内政治不稳定和脆弱的宏观经济环境”下所面临的经济挑战。</p>
<p>法国的服务业活动也未达到预期，企业报告需求低迷，订单推迟以及客户犹豫不决。未来12个月的整体商业预期自去年11月以来首次转为负面。</p>
<p><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/1e5dc424-7843-421e-9074-c56e5c12750f.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="491" data-wscnw="1577"/></p>
<p><strong>德国的PMI数据也令人失望，服务业同样出现下滑。</strong>尽管如此，德国新政府推动基础设施改革和重建军队的计划，有望在未来几年为经济提供支持。</p>

Title:  30年日债这么跌，会把30年美债一起拖下水？ 
Description:  <p>日本长期国债崩塌，会是全球债券市场的“金丝雀”预警？</p>
<p>近期，30年期日本国债收益率急剧上升至历史高位，目前已与德国30年期国债收益率相当，这在历史上很少出现。这一上升趋势始于4月中旬并持续至今，引发了市场对全球债市的担忧。</p>
<p>据追风交易台，<strong>摩根士丹利在最新的报告中表示，结构性供需失衡导致日债陷入“价值陷阱”，即便货币对冲后债券看起来“便宜”但可能进一步下跌。</strong></p>
<p><strong>进一步来看，日债崩塌或是全球债市结构性问题的预警信号，高盛在报告中表示，全球债市面临共同的三重压力：持续通胀压力、ALM投资者需求下降、政府融资需求高企。</strong></p>
<p>大摩也警告，日债持续走弱暗示美国长期国债也面临同样命运，美债收益率曲线可能进一步陡峭化。</p>

</div>
<p><strong>自4月初以来，30年期日债收益率已经飙升了85个基点，同期30年期美债收益率上升了60个基点。尽管货币对冲后的日债收益率对外国投资者看似极具吸引力，</strong>但摩根士丹利最新分析警告投资者，这可能是一个正在形成的&#34;价值陷阱&#34;。</p>
<p>从表面数据看，日债对外国投资者的吸引力确实惊人。大摩报告指出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>对美元投资者而言，30年期日债货币对冲后收益率高达7.03%，高于30年期美债的4.96%；</p>
<p>对欧元投资者，30年期日债货币对冲后收益率高达4.68%，较该地区同期限债券高出162个基点。</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">日本长期国债看似有价值，但大摩对此持谨慎态度。日本长期国债中正在形成的&#34;价值陷阱&#34;——即这些&#34;廉价&#34;债券可能会因结构性供应过剩和需求不足而进一步贬值。</p>
<p>这种矛盾局面的背后，是一场由结构性供需失衡驱动的危机，日本央行持有日本国债市场52%的份额，但随着央行开始逐步缩减其庞大的债券持有量，日本国债需求面临考验。</p>
<p>高盛进一步表示，技术性和仓位因素也加剧了抛售，包括杠杆做空和长期债券需求问题，抛售主要集中在长期债券，10年期-30年期收益率曲线的变陡程度超过了与即期收益率水平的通常关系。10年期期限溢价的衡量指标并未明显上升，2年期、5年期和10年期利率的变动也远低于30年期利率所暗示的平均水平。</p>

<p><strong>1. 持续通胀压力：</strong>日本与其他G10市场一样，通胀持续高于预期，前瞻性通胀预期攀升至周期性高点，迫使市场持续上调均衡收益率。日本核心通胀率已连续两年超过日本央行2%的目标。</p>
<p><strong>2. ALM投资者需求下降：</strong>随着市场利率上升，资产负债管理(ALM)账户的负债规模缩小，减少了对长期债券的需求。日本金融工具交易记录(JSDA)数据证实，国内对长期债券的持有已趋于平稳。</p>
<p><strong>3. 政府融资需求高企：</strong>各国政府的大规模融资需求对长期债券供应造成巨大压力。大多数发达市场国家的财政赤字率仍远高于疫情前水平，未来数年债务发行量将保持高位。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这些因素叠加导致全球范围内的长期债券面临不利环境。高盛变异分解模型显示，仅今年以来，30年期日债就对G4债券产生了约80个基点的上行压力，是G4市场中最大的看跌冲击源。4月2日以来这种压力几乎全部集中释放，可能反映了流动性不佳、风险管理谨慎和财政担忧加剧的综合影响。</p>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="68aeee83">从日债到美债：溢出效应将会加速吗？</h2>
</div>
<p>目前，市场焦点已转向日本长期债券暴跌是否会将美债一起拖下水的问题。</p>
<p><strong>摩根士丹利的研究显示，30年期日债收益率的上升，强化了美国国债收益率曲线趋陡的观点。</strong></p>
<p>大摩表示，长期美债的收益率与久期风险相比，性价比不高。 美国长期国债的风险收益比已显著劣于短期债券：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2年期及以下美债：每单位DV01风险收益率为0.91个基点</p>
<p>21年期以上美债：每单位DV01风险收益率仅为0.28个基点</p>
</blockquote>
<p>具体而言，投资者在持有较长期限美债时，获得的收益并未充分补偿其所承担的风险。同时，报告也指出，海外投资者购买长期美债的兴趣，需要来自预期回报以外的因素。考虑到对冲后的日债收益率对美国投资者具有明显吸引力，这可能导致投资组合重新配置，进一步打压美国长期债券市场。</p>
<h2>日本央行接下来会作何反应？</h2>
<p>日本央行未来政策走向将是市场关注焦点。</p>
<p>高盛分析表示，应对政策可能包括以下四种：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>降低发行债务期限（类似英国DMO做法）：</strong>就像英国的债务管理办公室一样，一种政策应对措施是持续降低已发行债务的期限。然而，英国的经验表明，虽然这可能有所帮助，但不太可能改变长期债务的根本价格。</li>
<li><strong>财政约束（短期内不太可能）：</strong>另一种可能性是财政紧缩，然而，最近的政策讨论并未指向有意义的紧缩。</li>
<li><strong>调整量化紧缩(QT)路径（包括对长期债券的购买）</strong>：关于量化紧缩，高盛的预期是，日本央行将维持每月减少日本国债购买规模的稳定步伐（从2026年4月起降至每月2万亿日元）。在即将于6月举行的会议上，围绕长期购买或市场运作的任何鸽派迹象，都可能为长期债券注入一些信心。</li>
<li><strong>重启加息周期：</strong>预计日本央行将在通胀压力下最终回归渐进式加息路径；我们经济学家维持2026年1月下一次加息的预测，终端利率将达到1.5%。这应该会对收益率曲线产生更大的平坦化压力，并控制长端风险溢价。</li>

Title:  人形机器人2026年量产！大摩感叹：小鹏的想象空间打开了，其他汽车公司同样如此 
Description:  <p>在5月21日的<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">财报电话会上</a>，小鹏汽车宣布2026年量产人形机器人。这听起来像是车企跨界试水的故事，很多人会问，小鹏造车还没做到行业第一，怎么有空搞机器人？</p>
<p>据追风交易台消息，5月22日摩根士丹利发布研报明确指出，小鹏做机器人不是分心，而是顺势。虽然小鹏不是头一个做人形机器人的车企，但他们有个隐藏buff——<strong>小鹏汽车在AI智能汽车领域打下了坚实基础。</strong></p>
<p>摩根士丹利指出，<strong>小鹏汽车约70%的AI技术可以共用</strong>，例如自动驾驶的大模型、图灵AI芯片和算法仿真平台，<strong>这些技术可以直接从汽车应用平移到人形机器人上</strong>。这表明小鹏汽车在AI智能汽车领域积累的技术和基础设施为其人形机器人项目提供了强大的支持。</p>
<p><strong>数据、能源、算法、制造……车企的底子就是为机器人准备的基础设施</strong>。简言之，这场人形机器人之战，车厂其实是天然的种子选手。</p>
<p>在电话会上，小鹏已明确提出三管齐下的增长战略——AI智能汽车、全球化扩张、人形机器人，这三条路线将帮助小鹏实现可持续的高成长。用CEO何小鹏的话来说：<strong>“我们的增长潜力才刚刚开始释放。”</strong></p>
<h2>四大技术共振，让小鹏从车走向“人”</h2>
<p>大摩指出，汽车企业做机器人，有天然的四大技术协同优势，小鹏几乎全都具备，其他汽车公司同样如此。</p>
<p><strong>一、数据优势：机器人大脑的“喂养素材”</strong></p>
<p data-start="497" data-end="514">大摩称，车企不只是有数据，而是有大量、多样化的真实世界数据，这让他们在发展机器人方面具备先发优势。</p>
<p data-start="497" data-end="514">这些数据来源包括，路上跑的自动驾驶数据、车内的智能座舱交互数据、工厂里的智能制造数据，甚至还拓展到了空中出行（EVTOL）领域的飞行数据。</p>
<p data-start="579" data-end="605">这些数据，能直接拿来喂AI大模型训练机器人。</p>
<p data-start="579" data-end="605"><strong>二、电池技术：决定机器人能动多久</strong></p>
<p data-start="579" data-end="605">机器人要跑得远、干得久，就得电池够强。</p>
<p data-start="322" data-end="410">大摩认为：“人形机器人想要脱离电源自由活动，最关键就是电池的能量密度（就是小体积装更多电）。而车企已经在电动化领域深耕了快20年，完全具备解决这个技术难题的能力。”</p>
<p><strong>三、AI决策：自动驾驶和机器人的决策中枢类似</strong></p>
<p data-start="339" data-end="440">大摩说道，自动驾驶技术这几年一直在推动机器学习和行为预测的边界，而车企在这个过程中已经搭建了大规模的仿真平台。现在这些平台和算法，也能被用来训练人形机器人，让机器人学会“看、想、动”。</p>
<p data-start="339" data-end="440"><strong>四、制造能力：真正能量产的护城河</strong></p>
<p data-start="953" data-end="992">说到底，机器人不是模型，是产品。很多实验室能做出Demo，但没量产能力。大摩表示，车企拥有成熟且可规模化的供应链，这种制造优势是显而易见的。</p>

Title:  爱奇艺已摘到了微短剧的果实 
Description:  <p style="text-align: right;"><img class="wscnph" title="" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/b4fd0e99-4a4c-4ed4-a3af-8d71f8226cec.jpeg" alt="" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnsize="87445" data-wscnh="594" data-wscnw="618"/>作者 | 黄昱</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">编辑 | 刘宝丹</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">作为“爱腾优芒”中唯一独立上市的长视频平台，爱奇艺（NASDAQ:IQ）的业绩一向具有行业风向标意义。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在长短剧集激战，爆款剧集诞生具有不确定性的背景下，爱奇艺试图通过多种变革来提升业绩增长的确定性，从最新的业绩表现来看，爱奇艺的探索已初见成效。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5月21日，爱奇艺发布截至2025年3月31日未经审计的第一季度财报。财报显示，一季度，爱奇艺总收入为71.9亿元，虽然同比仍然下滑约9%，但环比增长了9%；此外，Non-GAAP（非美国通用会计准则）运营利润为4.6亿元，同比下降58%，环比增长13%。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">具体业务表现来看，爱奇艺的支柱性收入来源——会员服务收入有所增长环比增长7%至44亿元，同比下降 8%；在线广告服务收入环比下降7%至13.3亿元，同比下降 10%；内容发行收入环比增长53%至6.3亿元，同比下降 32%；其他收入环比增长23.9%至8.3亿元，同比增长16%。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">爱奇艺创始人、首席执行官龚宇在当天财报电话会上表示，一季度取得的业绩环比增长得益于长视频内容强势回归和对微剧的战略投入。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在他看来，“好内容横竖都看爱奇艺”正在占领用户心智，为未来的商业化创造了机会。这些进展坚定了爱奇艺基于市场和用户需求变化，推进商业模式和内容生态进一步升级的信心。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">长视频内容目前依然是爱奇艺发展的根基。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">云合数据显示，爱奇艺当季长剧集总市占率继续保持第一。从爆款剧集来看，今年一季度爱奇艺“迷雾剧场”新作《漂白》撑起了门面，成为一季度唯一热度值破万的爆款剧集。该剧单集收入位列爱奇艺历史第三，仅次于《狂飙》《赘婿》。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">同期古偶剧《白月梵星》也有不错的表现，虽然没能破万，但热度值也达到了9600。此外，现偶剧《爱你》不仅在国内市场大获成功，也成为爱奇艺国际版表现最好的现偶大陆剧集。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">可以看到，在经历了2024年低谷期后，爱奇艺长剧集正在重新找回节奏。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2022年和2023年算是爱奇艺比较风光的两年。2022年，爱奇艺共有5部剧集热度值破万，要知道，在此之前爱奇艺仅有两部剧集热度过万。截至2023年底，爱奇艺热度破万的剧集已经达到十二部。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">去年全年，爱奇艺虽然持续产出了《追风者》《唐朝诡事录之西行》《我是刑警》3部爆款剧集，但其竞争对手在去年也都有亮眼的表现，这给其会员收入的增长带来了压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">如腾讯视频去年播出了近十部爆款剧集，而曾被外界视作“爱腾优芒”中存在感最弱的优酷，去年先是因为热播的《墨雨云间》重回聚光灯下，下半年又先后推出了《边水往事》《珠帘玉幕》《白夜破晓》等口碑热度都还算不错的剧集。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在自制综艺上拥有独特优势的芒果TV，去年先后上线的《歌手2024》、《再见爱人4》成为现象级爆款综艺，连在有些“掉队”的剧集内容上，也产出了《小巷人家》这一爆款。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">今年一季度，腾讯、芒果TV、优酷三家在爆款剧集上的表现也都有所表现，如腾讯视频有《大奉打更人》《雁回时》，芒果TV有《国色芳华》，优酷则有《难哄》。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">显然，在行业激烈竞争的背景下，爱奇艺一季度会员服务收入依然面临增长压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">在去年12月，爱奇艺还弄丢了曾经长视频平台月活用户第一的位置。据Quest Mobile数据，2024年12月，爱奇艺、腾讯视频的月活用户分别为3.54亿、3.87亿，芒果TV约为2.77亿，优酷则仅为1.84亿。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">从更受关注的会员数来看，爱奇艺日均订阅会员规模已从2023年一季度的1.29亿下降至第四季度的1.003亿，去年开始则不再公布会员数。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">不过，爱奇艺方面透露，今年一季度爱奇艺会员规模健康增长，季度月均单会员收入保持健康水平。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">这背后是，会员产品定位的完善满足了更广泛用户群体的需求。其中，家庭高端星钻会员引入加更礼免费看权益后展现良好增长潜力；高性价比的基础会员规模创新高，受到年轻及下沉市场用户欢迎，其中相当比例为首次订阅。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">据腾讯财报，作为爱奇艺的头号竞争对手，腾讯视频今年一季度日均付费会员数达到1.17亿元。这将为外界评估爱奇艺会员规模提供一定参照。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">此外，不难发现，在会员服务以及在线广告增长乏力的背景下，爱奇艺正通过多举措来强化商业化能力。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">出海已是爱奇艺一大核心战略。一季度，爱奇艺国际版收入同比增长超30%，广告收入同比增长40%，日均会员数创历史新高。过去半年，海外最受欢迎的大陆剧集Top10中爱奇艺自制剧占4席，其中《爱你》收入创国际版现偶大陆剧集历史新高。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">值得关注的是，在去年9月举办的2024爱奇艺iJOY秋季悦享会上，爱奇艺还宣布了要正式进军微短剧领域。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">按照爱奇艺的蓝图，“微剧场”将以每周两部新作的速度，聚焦男女频与银发族群，主打1—5分钟的竖屏内容；而“短剧场”则计划每周更新一部新作，涵盖古言、现偶、悬疑等多种类型，每集时长约在5—20分钟，以横屏呈现。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">到今年1月13日，爱奇艺还宣布与如今势头最猛的短剧平台红果短剧达成深度合作，将启动IP联合开发、联合出品、成品内容授权等合作，共同推出更多精品微短剧。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">然而，双方的合作似乎并不愉快。在今年2月20日，龚宇公开指责红果短剧利用场的主导地位，签署排他协议。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">不过，这样一个插曲似乎没有影响爱奇艺发力短剧的决心。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">春节期间，爱奇艺上线28部精品微剧，首创“微剧春节档”和微剧艺人微博直播接力拜年活动。《家里家外》《请君入我怀》等精品微剧的推出，持续加深用户对“在爱奇艺看微剧”的认知。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">爱奇艺主站App聚焦“会员免费观看”模式，以收费微剧为主；爱奇艺极速版主推免费微剧。目前爱奇艺已拥有超15000部微剧内容，其中免费微剧和会员微剧约各占一半。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">龚宇表示，微剧内容库的建设已经达成阶段性目标，目前片库内容储备充足，未来将重点引入更多头部新片，并全力发展自制内容。第二三阶段将着力通过微剧吸引新会员，特别是渗透率相对较低的下沉市场和高龄用户，让微剧内容助力提升会员服务收入，积极拓展微剧在广告和电商领域的货币化机会。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">据悉，从2024年12月到2025年4月，爱奇艺微剧重度用户，即在爱奇艺主要观看微剧的用户增长了3倍。</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">短剧之外，4月23日，在“2025爱奇艺世界·大会”上，爱奇艺还宣布启动以内容电商为核心的电商布局。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">爱奇艺方面表示，该战略目的是提升免费微剧业务的货币化能力，进一步发挥爱奇艺在IP、艺人资源以及优质用户等方面的优势。 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">如果电商业务能做好，这无疑也将能为爱奇艺在会员和广告之外，开拓新的收入来源。 </p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  微软CTO：AI已经“能力过剩”，行业需要努力缩小模型能力与实际产品交付之间的差距 
Description:  <p>微软CTO Kevin Scott日前接受媒体采访，就AI代理，编程的未来等一系列问题阐述了自己的观点。</p>
<p>在Scott看来，模型的推理能力已经超前于目前实际应用这些模型的方式。整个行业现在需要共同努力，去弥合模型实际能做的事情和交付给用户的产品之间的差距。</p>
<p>为了让代理（agents）真正变得有用，目前AI需要更好的代理记忆系统（以处理更复杂问题），同时需要一个生态系统，它应当像互联网那样（以获取信息）。</p>
<p>“AI代理编程”并不是过去四十年来软件开发第一次经历巨大变革。重点不是怎么做，而是要达成的目标。当工具发生变化时，要保持开放的心态。</p>
<p>以下是访谈重点：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>模型的推理能力已经超前于我们实际应用这些模型的方式。整个行业现在需要共同努力，去弥合模型实际能做的事情和我们交付给用户的产品之间的差距。</strong></p>
<p>除了“推理能力”之外，还有很多其他方面的问题需要解决，才能让代理（agents）真正变得有用。这意味着我们需要更好的代理记忆系统，同时需要一个生态系统，它应当像互联网那样。</p>
<p>如果你真正去想象代理能够做什么、普通用户希望它们变得多有用——你就会发现，我们需要像当年互联网兴起时那样的一系列变革再次发生。这一幕的雏形，比如MCP协议，它就是一个非常好的例子。</p>
<p><strong>“AI代理编程”并不是过去四十年来软件开发第一次经历巨大变革。</strong>不管是软件还是其他东西，重点不是怎么做，而是我要达成的目标。所以我会选择最强大、最方便的方式去实现它。<strong>当工具发生变化时，要保持开放的心态。</strong></p>
<p>我当木工的时间几乎跟我写程序一样久。我十几岁那会儿，圈子里最大的话题是：你如果用了电动工具，你还算是真正的木工吗？真正的木工只用手工工具！<strong>今天这种争论仍然存在，不过换成了：你用了 CNC（计算机控制的数控工具），你还算真正的木工吗？</strong></p>
<p>现在最关键的区别，出现在产品设计者的思维方式上。目前一些初创公司，他们并不是靠搞出一套全新的基础设施来创新的；<strong>他们创新的方式是：他们对某个用户问题的理解，比任何人都更深入。然后他们基于现成的基础设施，或做些微调，就能以世界级水准来解决那个问题。这种方式，才是我们现在真正需要的。</strong></p>
<p>我认为接下来我们会看到，人们用代理去解决的问题会越来越复杂、越来越有雄心。同时，“代理网络”会越来越完整，连接越来越充分；模型的推理与规划能力也会变得更强。这将促使我们从现在的“同步交互”模式，进入到一个更强的“异步交互”时代。</p>

<p>以下为对谈全文：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>主持人：<br/>Kevin，欢迎来到我们的节目。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>不用谢。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>谢谢你来。一件很有意思的事是，我去年也访问过你。你当时说了两件非常重要的事情。一个是——代理（agents）将会无处不在。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>你说的这件事真的成真了，而且来得非常快。还有一件事，我注意到去年你特别强调“规模定律”（scaling laws），对吧？</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>当时你展示了很多图表，说我们正在建造大规模基础设施，训练更大的模型，而且每两年性能就会有一次飞跃。但今年，你的重点似乎更多放在“代理网络（Agentic Web）”上。发生了什么变化？从去年到今年，我们学到了什么？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>是的，我觉得发生了很多变化。其中一件事是，<strong>去年很多人还处在一种怀疑状态中，他们在怀疑“规模定律”是否还能继续有效。而事实上，我们年复一年已经证明，它们依然有效并且运作良好。所以现在已经不再需要向人们重复这一点了。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>另一件事，说实话，<strong>是模型的推理能力已经超前于我们实际应用这些模型的方式。</strong>我最近一直在谈一个概念，叫做“能力悬空”（capability overhang）。</p>
<p>我认为，<strong>我们整个行业现在需要共同努力，去弥合模型实际能做的事情和我们交付给用户的产品之间的差距。</strong>这也是为什么在今年的 Build 大会上，“规模定律”不像去年那么吸引人的原因之一。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>还有一点我们发现了：随着过去一年代理数量的爆发式增长，以及用户在这些代理中花费时间的增加，我们意识到，<strong>除了“推理能力”之外，还有很多其他方面的问题需要解决，才能让代理真正变得有用。这也是我今天在 Build 大会主题演讲中提到的重点之一：我们需要更好的代理记忆系统。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>目前的代理记忆受限于许多方面，它们更像是一次性的、事务性的——你用它完成某个任务，期间记忆是连贯的，但这个记忆很可能会在下次交互时完全消失，这就使得我们很难将更复杂的任务委托给它们。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>而且还有一个核心问题：如果代理要变得有用，它们就必须能够替你采取行动，能够使用工具，在系统中作出改变，访问丰富多样的信息源。</p>
<p><strong>要实现这些，我们需要一个生态系统，它应当像互联网那样</strong>：如果你是信息源，你已经有了网站、有了 API，那么你必须弄清楚怎么把这些资源接通，让代理能与之通信，并且要让各方的激励机制协同一致，使他们愿意参与到这个“代理网络”中来。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>所以我认为这才是今年最大的故事——我们看到了真正进展的曙光，比如 MCP 这样的超级简单、开放协议，在代理网络中扮演的角色就像 HTTP 在互联网中一样。还有像 NL Web 这样的标准，它在“代理网络”中扮演的角色，就类似 HTML 在网页世界中的作用。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我觉得你将会看到这些系统越来越多地采用简单、可组合、可层叠的结构，开放社区将会非常活跃，最终推动代理真正实现能力的落地。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>那我总结一下我听到的意思：现在我们已经有了代理（agents），而且它们开始真正发挥作用了，对吧？而要让这些代理变得强大，它们就需要访问权限。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>它们需要能够访问互联网上的各种资源、你电脑上的内容，等等类似的信息。也就是说，你基本上需要建立起一套协议和流程，来让代理可以访问这些东西，对吧？</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>所以你现在关注的是整个技术堆栈的不同层级——比如说运行时层面，你们在那儿构建记忆系统、其他组件；然后还有像 MCP（memory coordination protocol）这样的协议，它能把代理连接到更广阔的互联网世界，从而获取信息，让信息流入代理系统中。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>那我想问一下，**这件事对微软来说为什么重要？**你们希望在这个生态系统里扮演什么样的角色？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>嗯，我觉得这里面有两点，也可能是三点特别重要。</p>
<p>第一点是，我们自己在做代理。而我们做的这些代理要对用户真正有用，就必须解决这些底层问题。就算你把范围缩小到企业级代理，<strong>作为微软的 CTO，我一直在推动的一件事就是：我希望我们公司内部所有系统都采用统一的标准协议，能和我们内部构建的代理对话。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>这样我们才能避免把整个世界暴露在所谓“康威定律”（Conway’s Law）之下。你知道，康威定律是软件架构里一个非常有趣的现象。</p>
<p>康威说，一个系统的结构往往会反映出开发该系统的组织结构，比如编译器的阶段数通常由负责这些部分的团队数量决定。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>没错。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>所以你想象一下，如果你在微软这样的大公司内部开发东西，你肯定不希望你造出来的代理，其结构完全是按照你的组织结构拼出来的。</p>
<p>但现实中如果你没有通用的协议和标准服务，这样的“组织图产品”就会反复出现。作为工程师，看到那种低效开发场景，真的很让人抓狂。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>但我认为，更重要的是，如果你真正去想象代理能够做什么、<strong>普通用户希望它们变得多有用——你就会发现，我们需要像当年互联网兴起时那样的一系列变革再次发生。我现在就能看到这一幕的雏形，比如 MCP 协议，它就是一个非常好的例子。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>它是一个非常简单但关键的协议，解决了一个非常重要的问题——不仅是为那些构建代理和平台基础设施的人服务，也同样帮助了系统的最终用户，让他们的体验变得更加有用。它还为那些服务提供方提供了机会，比如有人可能会说：“我也想参与到这个新型的大网络里来。”</p>
<p>但现在的问题是，很多人以前知道怎么去连接某个服务、怎么构建服务，但如今他们面对的是一群代理，坐在那里思考：“我该怎么把我的系统接进来？这对我到底意味着什么？”</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>甚至从商业模式的角度来说，他们也会想：我为什么要接入这个系统？它对我到底有什么价值？</p>
<p><strong>所以第二点就是——我们希望让自己构建的代理变得更有用。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>第三点是，作为一家平台型公司，这一点甚至比我们自己要写的代理更重要。微软已经在构建平台技术这条路上深耕了五十年，我们想要确保，当这个全新的“超级网络”兴起时，我们能够帮助解决其中出现的问题。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>是啊，看到你们现在在 MCP 上投入这么多，并把它整合进整个 Windows 系统，真的很酷，很厉害。这让我想到一个问题——我最近听到一些人在讨论 MCP，他们开始关注它的安全模型问题。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>我很好奇你是怎么看这个问题的。因为你前面提到过很多 MCP 技术栈和互联网技术栈之间的类比。而我们知道，互联网是有一套完整的安全机制的，比如“同源策略”（Same-Origin Policy），它确保了网站在执行代码时只能操作自己域名下的数据，对吧？但 MCP 目前似乎还没有类似的机制。所以你觉得，什么样的安全模型才是适合 MCP 的？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>嗯，说实话，我也不敢说我完全知道什么才是“正确”的安全模型。但 MCP 有一点很有趣，就是它的设计极其简洁明了，这其实使得整个社区可以相对容易地就这个问题达成共识。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我们在企业层面上确实有很多非常重视的需求，我们也和 MCP 团队合作得很好，正在推进相关工作。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>比如说，我们需要让代理具有“身份”——这样我们才能建立起权限系统。你可以定义：某个代理是代表某个用户在操作，然后它就有权访问系统中某些资源。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>甚至代理本身可以主动查询多个系统，然后说：“这是我想完成的一件事，要实现这件事，我需要访问以下这些系统。那我需要获得哪些权限才能做这件事？”</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>它可以向被委托给它的用户请求授权，说：“你能不能给我访问这些资源的权限，这样我才能替你完成你交代的任务？”是或否。</p>
<p>然后系统管理员也需要有权限来审查，比如：“我是否允许这些操作发生？”所以，这整个流程虽然并不“简单”，但其实在 MCP 架构上实现起来是可行的、逻辑清晰的。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>而关键在于：我们应该以开放的方式来做这件事。我们并不希望这些机制是专属于微软代理或微软系统的——我们真正需要的是让它像互联网一样运作的生态系统。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>对我来说，这其实是个很有意思的问题。我觉得现在围绕 AI 的发展，有两种可能的模式或者“市场路径”（Go-to-Market）正在浮现，而你们微软似乎都在关注这两个方向。</p>
<p>一种是所谓的“垂直一体化”模式，在这种模式下，你控制模型、应用、整个上下游——一切都在你手中。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>而这种模式的一个好处是：安全性可以得到很强的保障。就像苹果的 App Store 或 iPhone 模式，你可以在多个层面上强制安全策略。</p>
<p>但另一种则是“开放模型”——你牺牲一部分控制权和安全性，但能换来更强的创新活力，因为没有中心化的权威机构去限制开发者。</p>
<p>所以我想问的是，你们在微软是怎么思考要走哪条路的？你们是怎么做出这个决策的？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>是的，你看，这确实是很多人现在在讨论的一个核心问题——但我觉得，那可能是一个伪命题（false dichotomy）。</p>
<p>你知道，在这些开放系统中，它们的特点是“无需许可”（permissionless）。这种开放式创新的能力，确实带来了巨大的优势。对我个人来说，现在最让我兴奋的一件事就是：你可以不经任何人批准就去创新、去构建产品，不需要别人给你发许可，不需要通过什么中介流程才能把你的作品推向世界。</p>
<p>你不再需要通过一堆复杂的守门人机制，在你这个有想法的人与那些可能真正从中受益的人之间设下重重阻碍。</p>
<p>Kevin Scot：<br/>我觉得我们这几年建立起来的那些“中间层”，其实并没有为最核心的两方带来多少价值：一边是辛辛苦苦做出东西的人，另一边是愿意为这些成果付出注意力、金钱或其他资源的用户。</p>
<p>这就是为什么我对开放系统特别兴奋，也正是我们在做战略选择时的重要原因之一。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>但我也认为，在这些系统中，其实是有办法实现强健安全性的。我们可以借助 AI 本身的一些能力，构建出更智能的安全模型。</p>
<p>比如说，你运行的代理可以照顾到你个人的安全需求——哪些信息你愿意分享，哪些你不愿意；它还能做风险评估。</p>
<p>我举个实际例子：今天早上我正准备上台演讲的时候，突然收到一堆邮件，因为我是我妻子的备用安全账户。</p>
<p>有人在她账户上尝试篡改两步验证（2FA）设置。我第一反应是发短信给她，而不是发邮件——因为我担心她的邮箱可能已经被未经授权的第三方访问了。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我发信息问她：“你是不是在改配置？”她回复：“是的，是我。”</p>
<p>所以你可以想象，<strong>如果有一个代理可以接入你多种通信渠道，监测到这种异常行为，并调用各种资源进行“三角校验”，判断这些行为到底是合法的还是非法的，那将是非常有用的。</strong></p>
<p><strong>所以我认为，两种模式是可以共存的。并不是说非得二选一——就像你刚才设想的那样。</strong></p>
<p>主持人：<br/>这很有道理。我还有一个特别好奇的问题是——现在看来，软件工程正在发生根本性变化，对吧？</p>
<p>而你是一个在软件工程领域深耕多年的老兵，我觉得你也很重视“工艺”本身——制作事物的技艺。</p>
<p>我们刚才聊到你平时做陶艺、做包，喜欢亲手参与制作的过程。我觉得很多人对“用代理写代码”有点抵触，觉得这样会削弱那种“手工打造”的感觉，虽然我并不完全同意这个观点。</p>
<p>但我还是很想知道，<strong>作为一个真正关心编程工艺的人，你怎么看待未来的“代理编程”？</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我先说一句，我真的很欣赏“我的人”——我这里说的“我的人”，指的是广义的创作者群体。</p>
<p>包括软件工程师、机械工程师、木工、陶艺师等等这些人。我们都是从零或者原材料开始创造新东西的人。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>如果你真的热爱你的工作，你一定会对怎么做、用什么工具、用什么材料、如何组合这些细节有非常强烈的主张。这是你成为真正优秀从业者的必备条件。</p>
<p>但有趣的是——人们的观点五花八门。</p>
<p>正如你刚才提到的，我做这行已经很久了——我写第一个程序的时候只有 12 岁，也就是说我编程已经有 41 年了。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>如果你在一个领域坚持得够久，你就会看到：这并不是过去四十年来软件开发第一次经历巨大变革。每次这种变革发生时，人们都会对其含义有非常强烈的反应。</p>
<p>但现实是，人们是有选择权的。</p>
<p>我现在仍然喜欢用文本编辑器。说实话，我可能不该说这个，因为我们公司做了 Visual Studio Code（笑），但我就是一个老古板——我还在用 vim。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>至少我会用 vim，但我最爱的还是那种古早的编辑器。我就是不愿意换别的工具。</p>
<p>尽管我知道，这在某种程度上已经降低了我的效率，但我还是出于“自主选择”的理由坚持使用它。</p>
<p>但在我做的其他项目中，比如不管是软件还是其他东西，有时候我也会说：“这里的重点不是怎么做，而是我要达成的目标。”</p>
<p><strong>所以我会选择最强大、最方便的方式去实现它——不管别人会不会因此嘲笑我。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>这种情况无处不在。<strong>比如我当木工的时间几乎跟我写程序一样久。</strong></p>
<p><strong>我还记得我十几岁那会儿，圈子里最大的话题是：“你如果用了电动工具，你还算是真正的木工吗？”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“真正的木工只用手工工具！”</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/><strong>今天这种争论仍然存在，不过换成了：“你用了 CNC（计算机控制的数控工具），你还算真正的木工吗？”</strong></p>
<p>我觉得这种讨论本身就很有意思，但最终大家做出不同选择，是因为他们的价值观不同。</p>
<p>如果你更重视过程，你可能会做出完全不同的选择；而如果你更看重结果，你就可能用别的方式。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>我觉得类似“你算不算是真正的木工”“你是不是个真正的程序员”这种问题，说到底其实是在说：“只有按照我成长时的方式去做，你才是真正的XXX。”这其实是一种有偏见的说法。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>对，是这样。但现实是——这个世界的情况太多样化了，对吧？</p>
<p>所以我要说的是：我绝不会告诉任何人不要对自己的技艺有强烈的主张。你尽管有你的坚持，那很好！</p>
<p>但如果说我有什么建议的话（这不是命令，只是我个人发现有用的建议），<strong>那就是——当工具发生变化时，要保持开放的心态。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我都数不清多少次了，有些新的技术出现在其他“非软件”的创作领域，我一开始都会下意识地抗拒——<strong>比如说我当时对 3D 打印机完全提不起兴趣，我拖了很久才去学怎么用它们。</strong></p>
<p>现在我真的后悔了，因为它们几乎对我做的所有事都非常有用。出于种种复杂的原因，我没有让自己产生好奇心，这是我自己的问题，也确实有点奇怪。</p>
<p><strong>所以我的建议就是：保持好奇，去尝试。如果某样东西适合你，那就用它；如果不适合，也无妨。</strong></p>
<p>主持人：<br/>没错。那么你怎么看“软件工程代理（software engineering agents）”的未来？</p>
<p>会不会出现那种“一个代理统治一切”的局面？还是说我们会同时使用很多具有不同风格的代理？你认为这个生态系统会如何发展？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我认为将来一定是有很多不同类型的代理。这是好事。</p>
<p>我们当然会在 GitHub Copilot 以及我们正在开发的 GitHub Agent 上非常努力，希望成为很多开发者首选的工具，因为我们想让它真的对大家有用。</p>
<p><strong>但要说全世界的开发者都统一使用某一个工具来完成工作中的关键部分，我认为那不现实。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>成为一个开发者的乐趣之一，就是你有权选择工具。你可以尝试各种东西，做一些看起来“非理性”的事，也可以选择完全理性的方式。</p>
<p>这是我在过去四十年程序员生涯中始终观察到的一件事：人们不断更换自己的工具。总是在变化。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>那你有没有想过：这些代理会在哪些维度上有所不同？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/><strong>我觉得最关键的区别，可能会出现在产品设计者的思维方式上。</strong></p>
<p><strong>现在我看到最有意思的一些初创公司，他们并不是靠搞出一套全新的基础设施来创新的；他们创新的方式是：他们对某个用户问题的理解，比任何人都更深入。</strong></p>
<p><strong>然后他们基于现成的基础设施，或做些微调，就能以世界级水准来解决那个问题。这种方式，才是我们现在真正需要的。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>这也会推动代理多样性的形成——哪些代理被用来解决什么问题，最终都会受到这个维度的驱动。</p>
<p>而且说实话，现在你更容易对用户的问题形成这种“细致入微的理解”，也更容易拿起各种工具尝试去解决这些问题。</p>
<p>所以我们会看到大量公司、团队去打造各种东西来尝试解决不同的需求。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>哪怕在“软件开发工具”这个领域都已经开始疯狂了——过去一年冒出来的工具简直数不过来。</p>
<p>而且这些工具都挺有趣的，各有各的特点。</p>
<p>对于像我们这样的软件工具开发公司来说，这确实压力很大，因为你要应对那么多创新和变化。</p>
<p>但从技术角度来看，这真的太有意思了。</p>
<p>我们发现：<strong>只要你对用户的需求有某种细腻的认知，就总会有人愿意尝试你的解决方案。尤其是那些有高容忍度和高兴趣度的用户。</strong></p>
<p>主持人：<br/>是啊。我们时间快到了，但我还有个问题。</p>
<p>假设一年之后我们又在 Build 大会上坐下来聊，你觉得：现在的一些热门话题或大问题，一年后会变得不再重要？而一年后什么会成为真正重要的讨论焦点？你有哪些预测？</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/><strong>我觉得现在那些还在坚持说“这项技术还没准备好”的人——比如说：“我试过了，但稍微有点贵”或者“功能上还差一点点”——如果他们把这些当作不行动的借口，那他们很快就会被远远甩在后面。</strong></p>
<p>因为这些问题都会随着时间变得微不足道：技术每年都会变得更便宜、更强大。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我觉得在 2025 年，这个观点其实已经不需要“游说”了。过去确实有很多人大声说：“技术进展很快就会停滞，大家都会失望。”</p>
<p>虽然现在还有人这么说，但我觉得已经没什么人认真听他们的了。毕竟你听这些“唱衰者”的话，又能获得什么呢？你是在赌失败，而“赌失败”和“赌乐观”之间的成本差异，其实非常大。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/><strong>我认为接下来我们会看到，人们用代理去解决的问题会越来越复杂、越来越有雄心。同时，“代理网络”会越来越完整，连接越来越充分；模型的推理与规划能力也会变得更强。这将促使我们从现在的“同步交互”模式，进入到一个更强的“异步交互”时代。</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>现在的交互方式是：你坐下来，想着要完成一件事，然后给代理发出指令，等它返回一个结果，然后你基于那个结果再操作。</p>
<p><strong>但到了明年，你可能会看到这样的使用方式：“嘿，去帮我搞定这件事。”</strong></p>
<p><strong>然后代理会花时间去处理：它会调用很多外部系统，它会去整合信息，它会反复迭代，它会不断处理、汇总、推进，最后，在一个非即时但有深度的时间之后，代理会告诉你：“我已经帮你推进到这一步了，接下来轮到你了。”</strong></p>
<p>主持人：<br/>听起来真是我想活在的未来。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>我也这么想，真心的。</p>
<p>主持人：<br/>好吧，Kevin，非常感谢你今天来参加节目。真的非常精彩的谈话。</p>
<p>Kevin Scott：<br/>很高兴能和你聊这场对话，我也非常享受，谢谢你邀请我来。</p>

Title:  美债砸盘、美元也跌，德银警告：这次就算美联储QE也救不了！ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">美国债券遭遇的拍卖失利，同时美元也在走弱，显示出外国投资者正“罢买”美国资产。德银认为只有国会，而非美联储才能解决这个问题。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，德意志银行在最新的报告中表示，这一危机的核心在于外国投资者不再愿以当前价格水平为美国财政与经常账户双赤字提供融资，而且这一问题只能由国会通过紧缩财政来解决，而非美联储的货币政策干预。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">面对这一日益严峻的局势，德意志银行明确警告“为更多波动做好准备”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">同时，德银表示，美股韧性也将受到考验，而亚洲投资者行为将成为关键风向标，投资者应密切关注亚洲交易时段的美债和美元反应。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美股也危险了，亚洲投资者成关键风向标</h2>
<p>德银表示，在这种环境下，美股很难保持韧性。</p>
<blockquote>
<div>2023-24年期间，美国收益率和股票的上涨是市场对美国增长预期的重新评估。这是完全合理的。今天则非常不同。这完全是对美国资产的财政风险溢价的增加，很难证明这种（资本成本上升的负面）驱动因素能对风险资产产生积极影响。</div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">德意志银行分析师George Saravelos强调，关注亚洲投资者的行为：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据其外部净平衡框架，亚洲是美国赤字最主要的资金提供者，其次是欧洲。因此，美国之安全和汇率的表现在非美国交易时段变得尤为关键。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>如果美元/日元在东京交易时段加速下行，这将是资本从美国回流国内市场的强烈信号。</strong>因此，投资者应密切关注亚洲交易时段的市场反应，这可能预示危机的进一步发展。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美联储干预没用，只有国会行动：财政紧缩或美债贬值</h2>
<p>德银表示，解决这个问题并不容易，金融抑制的形式，例如SLR改革和在下一次再融资公告中缩短美债发行期限已经被频繁提及。在某种程度上，缩短美国债务组合的久期有助于吸引外国买家，但较低的久期也意味着更高的债务展期风险。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">德银特别强调，只有国会才能解决这个问题，最终解决这一问题只有两种“方案”：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">极端的市场错位可能会促使美联储采取干预措施（QE）以维持市场正常运作，但这实际上无法解决问题的核心，甚至可能因提高通胀预期而适得其反。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>这个问题只有两个“解决方案”：要么美国大幅修改目前国会中的和解法案，以实现更严格的财政政策；要么美国债务的非美元价值需要大幅下降（如美元贬值），直到其变得足够便宜以吸引外国投资者回归。</strong></p>
</blockquote>

Title:  连增三月？OPEC+讨论7月大幅增产，沙特出手惩戒“配额叛徒” 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">OPEC+将在7月再次大幅增产？油市或面临新一轮下行压力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据媒体周四报道，<strong>OPEC+正在讨论在6月1日的月度会议上，批准7月再次大幅增产41.1万桶/日，几乎是最初计划的三倍。</strong>如果该计划获批，那么这将成为OPEC+连续第三个月大幅增产。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">消息传出后，<strong>布伦特原油短线下挫至63.92美元/桶，跌破64美元关口，日内跌幅达1.5%。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/578b1b69-0a8e-40d3-8901-9ad877a27582.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="566" data-wscnw="836"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3744556?keyword=OPEC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及</a>，<strong>OPEC+加速增产的决定意在对那些超配额生产的成员国施压，</strong>同时也为这些国家提供更大的机会进行补偿性减产，来弥补过去的“作弊”行为。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在上次会议上，沙特阿拉伯警告过度生产的成员国称，除非他们遵守配额，否则沙特可能会放大这一历史性政策转变并继续增加产量。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">与特朗普在4月发起贸易战的时间相吻合，OPEC+的意外增产最初对油价造成了沉重打击，导致布伦特原油跌至近60美元的四年低点。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>如果OPEC+确认连续第三月大幅增产，油价可能面临新一轮下行压力。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尽管OPEC+声称增产是为了满足需求，但市场对供应过剩的担忧正在加剧。上周，国际能源署（IEA）预测，由于“经济逆风”，在强劲的第一季度之后，2025年余下时间全球石油需求增长将放缓。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高盛据此预测，<strong>在同意7月增产后，OPEC+将暂停进一步增产。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">除了6月的月度会议外，OPEC+的22个成员国还将于5月28日举行第39届OPEC+部长级会议<span id="docs-internal-guid-08ab46b1-7fff-7375-0f3f-b367dcd317ea"></span>，审查2025年和2026年的基本产量配额。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">令人瞩目的是，美银渠道调查显示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">4月份美国/欧盟市场同比增长约8倍/5倍，这进一步印证了Labubu 3.0的成功及其对海外市场的积极推动。尽管美国加征关税导致价格上涨，但似乎并未对其受欢迎程度产生不利影响。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>在线上渠道，Labubu 3.0发布后，泡泡玛特官方应用在美国App Store购物类别中跃升至第一位。泡泡玛特美国Tik Tok 粉丝数也从3月的43.12万增至72.29万（+68%），4月在Tik Tok零售销售方面排名第一。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">线下方面，根据美银渠道调查，今年以来公司已新增14家零售店，主要分布在美国、欧盟和东南亚。值得注意的是，泡泡玛特优先选择地标（牛津街）、文化场所（卢浮宫）和高端购物中心（MEGA Bangna）开设零售店，为消费者提供沉浸式体验和社交功能。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>根据美银预测，泡泡玛特预计将在海外/国内市场新开110/20家零售店，到2025年底总数将达到约650家。</strong></p>
<h2 id="f2cbfd71">国内市场销售加速增长，业绩高增长为估值提供支撑</h2>
<p>与此同时，泡泡玛特在国内市场增长动力依然强劲。</p>
<p><strong>根据Meritco数据库，4月份泡泡玛特通过在线电商平台（包括天猫、京东、抖音）的销售同比增长287%，较2025年第一季度(+223%)加速，其中天猫/京东/抖音分别增长156%/66%/457%。国内线下同店销售增长明显加速，增长50%（相比2025年第一季度+23%）。</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">美银维持对泡泡玛特的买入评级，目标价236港元（为市场最高预测）。分析师认为，公司正朝着&#34;世界的泡泡玛特&#34;目标稳步推进全球布局，并将泡泡玛特作为消费板块中结构性增长的首选之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">根据美银预测，泡泡玛特2025年营收将达到226.01亿港元，净利润将达到65亿港元，同比增长91%；2026年将达到101.1亿港元，同比增长55.5%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">业绩高增长为当前估值提供了有力支撑，目前，泡泡玛特股价约为207港元，对应2025年42.42倍市盈率，2026年27.27倍市盈率。考虑到其高速增长，这一估值水平仍具吸引力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e64c0203-02f7-4db5-a187-e6839102ef72.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="239" data-wscnw="694" data-wscnsize="43489"/></p>

Title:  摩根大通戴蒙：美国仍面临滞胀风险，美联储不降息是正确的 
Description:  <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">据彭博社5月22日报道，摩根大通CEO Jamie Dimon在全球中国峰会上接受采访时表示，他无法排除美国经济陷入滞胀的可能性，认为美国正面临地缘政治、财政赤字和物价压力的重大风险。</p>
<p>这位华尔街顶级银行家直言不讳地说道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>我不同意我们（的经济）正处于最佳状态的说法。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>同时，戴蒙强调美联储保持观望态度、暂不降息的策略是正确的。而这一尖锐立场与市场普遍乐观情绪形成鲜明对比。</p>

Title: Supreme Court says Trump can fire agency heads for now, but insulates Fed
Description: <p>The Supreme Court issued a stay Thursday allowing President Trump's removal of two independent agency heads to remain in force for now — but suggested <a href="https://www.axios.com/economy/federal-reserve" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a> officials have special protection based on the central bank's unique structure.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The ruling suggests that the court will ultimately vest the president with significant authority to remove the heads of agencies, even when Congress has structured them to be insulated from politics. </p><hr><ul><li>But the decision's carve-out for the Fed will come as a significant relief to markets that were concerned about the central bank's independence.</li></ul><p><strong>Catch up quick: </strong>The court issued a stay Thursday night in a case involving Trump's move to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.</p><ul><li>"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power," and that therefore it is within the executive authority of the president to remove them, the court's majority wrote.</li><li>But is is not a final decision. The question of whether the NLRB and MSPB appointments fall under certain exceptions "is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument."</li><li>The order was unsigned, and the three liberal justices dissented, arguing that a stay should be granted.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>In issuing the stay, the majority noted a claim by the fired members that their case could have implications for the president's ability to remove members of the Fed's Board of Governors or Open Market Committee.</p><p><strong>What they're saying: "</strong>We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States," the majority wrote.</p><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>A dissent by Justice Elena Kagan seemed impatient with the logic of the Fed carve-out. </p><ul><li>"The majority closes today's order by stating, out of the blue, that it has no bearing on" removal of Fed officials.</li><li>"I am glad to hear it," Kagan writes, "and do not doubt the majority's intention to avoid imperiling the Fed."</li><li>"But then, today's order poses a puzzle. For the Federal Reserve's independence rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on—which is to say it rests largely on" Humphrey's Executor, a 1935 case establishing the constitutionality of independent agencies.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>From the moment Trump started removing agency commissioners earlier this year, analysts predicted the ultimate target might be more control over the Fed.</p><ul><li>But some hoped past court <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/21/fed-trump-independent-agencies" target="_blank">comments</a> about the central bank as a unique entity might insulate it from such action. </li></ul><p><em>Editor's note: This story has been updated with new details throughout. </em></p>

Title: Iran threatens to move nuclear material to secret sites to thwart Israeli strike
Description: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/world/iran" target="_blank">Iran</a> threatened on Thursday to move its nuclear material to undeclared sites to protect it from a potential Israeli military strike. </p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The threat, made in an <a href="https://x.com/iran_un/status/1925569265987363091?s=46" target="_blank">official letter</a> from Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to the UN secretary-general and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director-general, signal the risk of an unprecedented escalation in the Iranian nuclear crisis. </p><hr><ul><li>The IAEA is currently able to access and monitor Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, which are stored in declared sites. </li><li>If that material is moved, it will be much harder to know whether Iran is building a nuclear weapon or not. </li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The threat comes after CNN and Axios reported that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/israel-strike-iran-nuclear-facilities" target="_blank">Israel has been making preparations</a> to swiftly strike Iran's nuclear sites if U.S.-Iran nuclear talks break down in the coming weeks. </p><ul><li>One source told Axios that <a href="https://www.axios.com/world/israel" target="_blank">Israel</a> believes its operational window for a successful strike could close soon.</li></ul><p><strong>What they are saying:</strong> "Under conditions wherein threats made by the Zionist fanatics persist, the Islamic Republic of Iran shall be left with no recourse but to implement special measures for the protection of its nuclear facilities and materials, the relevant particulars of which shall thereafter be communicated to the IAEA," Araghchi wrote. </p><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> Araghchi and White House envoy Steve Witkoff will hold a fifth round of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/iran-deal-proposal-witkoff-enrichment" target="_blank">nuclear talks</a> in Rome on Friday, with Oman's foreign minister mediating.</p><ul><li>The negotiations have hit a roadblock over the fact that Iran says it will only sign a deal that allows a domestic enrichment capability, and the U.S. has said enrichment is its red line.</li><li>Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and the director of Israel's Mossad spy agency David Barnea will meet Witkoff in Rome on Friday on the sidelines of the nuclear talks, two Israeli officials said. </li><li>The officials said Dermer and Barnea are traveling to Rome to coordinate positions with Witkoff and be briefed immediataely after the talks.</li></ul><p><strong>State of play: </strong>The Israeli intelligence community has shifted just in the past few days from believing a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/16/trump-confirms-us-gave-iran-proposal-for-nuclear-deal" target="_self">nuclear deal</a> was close to thinking talks could soon break down, Israeli sources say. </p><ul><li>Hence the urgency behind Israel's preparations to strike fast if President Trump gives a green light.</li><li>A U.S. official told Axios the Trump administration is concerned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might make his move even without approval from Trump.</li><li>Trump spoke to Netanyahu on Thursday and they "agreed on the need to ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons," per the Israeli readout.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side:</strong> Araghchi wrote in his letter that Iran "will take all necessary measures to protect and defend its citizens, interests, and facilities against any terrorist or sabotage actions."</p><ul><li>"Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Israeli Zionist regime and will respond decisively to any threats or unlawful actions by this regime. We also believe that if any attack is carried out against the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Israeli regime, the U.S. government will be complicit and bear legal responsibility," the Iranian foreign minister wrote. </li></ul>

Title: Trump's Education Department closure and layoffs blocked by federal judge
Description: <p>A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/05/trump-federal-education-funding-map-schools" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> while a lawsuit challenging the move proceeds.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The judge's preliminary injunction said that <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Trump</a> and Education Secretary Linda McMahon don't have the power to shutter the agency — and that its closure runs contrary to federal laws. </p><hr><ul><li>U.S. District Judge Myong J.

Title: 5 key takeaways from highly anticipated MAHA commission report
Description: <p><strong>President Trump's</strong> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/13/trump-maha-commission-rfk-chronic-illness" target="_blank">Make America Healthy Again Commission</a> blamed factors including bad diets, chemical exposure and unnecessary medication for causing childhood chronic illness in a highly anticipated report released Thursday.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The 68-page document from a panel led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seeks to lay out a unifying theory around what's causing conditions like obesity, autoimmune conditions and behavioral disorders in kids.</p><hr><ul><li>But it was developed in little more than three months and seeks to strike a balance between protecting consumers and promoting economic interests, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/rfk-roundup-weedkiller-chronic-disease-glyphosate" target="_blank">pesticides</a> and chemicals commonly used in agriculture. </li><li>"This is not, in any way, an attack on the American farmers or industry," NIH director Jay Bhattacharya, a member of the commission, told reporters Thursday. "What this is is a commitment to get excellent answers, excellent science, so that we can enable people to do the right thing." </li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>As with Kennedy's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/maha-movement-federal-health-agencies" target="_blank">broader health care philosophy,</a> the report blends mainstream ideas with highly controversial elements, including doubts about the current childhood vaccine schedule.</p><p><strong>Here are the key takeaways:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Ultra-processed foods. </strong>The commission, in the first and longest section, acknowledges that popular snacks and beverages save Americans time and money, but cites research that suggests <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/food-dye-ban-rfk-pepsi" target="_blank">ultra-processed foods</a> are linked to chronic diseases and says children need more "whole foods." </p><ul><li>"I think everybody wants to prioritize the ultra-processed food crisis and try to reduce our reliance on ultra-processed foods and try to improve the quality of the food," Kennedy said on Thursday. </li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Chemical exposures. </strong>Potential toxins in the environment are a big concern, but the Trump administration is treading lightly. </p><ul><li>Farm groups <a href="https://www.agweb.com/news/policy/politics/farmers-brace-impact-what-maha-report-could-mean-agriculture" target="_blank">worried</a> ahead of the report's release that it would target pesticides like glyphosate, which are widely used in agriculture. </li><li><strong>"</strong>American farmers rely on these products, and actions that further regulate or restrict crop protection tools beyond risk-based and scientific processes set forth by Congress must involve thoughtful consideration of what is necessary for adequate protection, alternatives, and cost of production," the report states.</li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>More "gold-standard science." </strong>The report also portrays research on chemical exposure and chronic disease as a necessary competitive advantage for the U.S.<strong> </strong></p><ul><li>Understanding potential links between chemical exposure and chronic illness <strong>"</strong>cannot happen through a European regulatory system that stifles growth," the report says. Rather, it should happen through science done by the federal government and "through unleashing private sector innovation."</li></ul><p><strong>4. Overuse of medicine. </strong>The commission calls out kids' "overmedicalization" — and continues to cast <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/fda-limits-covid-boosters" target="_blank">doubt on childhood vaccines</a>. </p><ul><li>It cites a 1,400% increase in antidepressant prescriptions for American adolescents between 1987 and 2014, as well as increased prescribing of stimulants, antibiotics and asthma drugs. </li><li>Long-term research on the impact of commonly used drugs for kids is limited, but there are "contributory human data that raise important questions" about antidepressants, stimulants and other treatments, the report says. </li><li>The commission also questions the current U.S. childhood vaccine protocol and says vaccines would benefit from "more rigorous clinical trial designs." Vaccines are <a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p2073.pdf" target="_blank">already studied</a> in large trials and subject to ongoing safety surveillance. </li></ul><p><strong>5</strong>. <strong>Corporate influence. </strong>The role of corporate interests features prominently in the report, despite assurances that it's not anti-industry. </p><ul><li>Misaligned incentives in federal regulations and significant scientific funding from food, pharmaceutical, tech and chemical companies contribute to the rise of chronic disease, the report claims. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>The secretaries of agriculture, education and housing, as well as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal officials, sit on the 14<strong>-</strong>member commission. </p><ul><li>White House deputy chief of staff <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/08/stephen-miller-dei-outside-trump-white-house" target="_blank">Stephen Miller</a> is a member, along with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who co-authored the Heritage Foundation's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/trump-executive-orders-list-project-2025-policies" target="_blank">Project 2025</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next: </strong>The commission now has about 80 days to create a strategy for how the federal government should respond, per Trump's original <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank">February order</a>. </p><ul><li>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that updated dietary guidelines will likely be released before this fall. </li><li>"What you're going to see is a whole new day on dietary guidelines where federal nutrition advice will be sound. It will be simple, and it will be clear," Rollins said. </li></ul>

Title: Why the bond market is barfing
Description: <p>Around the world, investors are sending a clear-as-glass signal: After years of profligate debt issuance, the world's major <a href="https://www.axios.com/economy" target="_blank">economies</a> are now facing the bill.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>A sell-off in bond markets over recent weeks is signaling that the long-term trajectory for interest rates is higher than it has been in decades. The drop in long-term bond prices means a rise in the interest rates governments must pay to borrow money.</p><hr><ul><li>The anticipated multitrillion-dollar widening of U.S. deficits due to the tax cut and spending legislation that passed the House early Thursday morning is part of the story, as is the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/moodys-credit-rating-us-debt-reason" target="_blank">Moody's downgrade</a> of the U.S. government's credit rating last week.</li><li>But it's really a bigger, global phenomenon — suggesting a step-shift in what savers demand to tie up their money in the long term across major advanced economies.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield touched 5.13% at one point Thursday morning, the highest since 2007. On Wednesday, an auction of 20-year bonds showed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tepid-demand-us-treasury-auction-shows-investor-jitters-about-tax-bill-deficit-2025-05-21/" target="_blank">surprisingly soft demand</a>.</p><ul><li>In Japan, with the highest ratio on Earth of debt to the size of its economy, long-term bond yields have hit new <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/791cbe4c-2ab5-46e3-9a23-492e86edebcb" target="_blank">all-time highs</a> this week.

Title: Are you middle class? It depends who you ask in Congress
Description: <p>The upper bound of "middle class" in America is often pegged at an annual income of between $150,000 and $250,000, but looking at <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/mike-johnson-budget-bill-trump-salt-taxes" target="_blank">legislation</a> being drawn up by Republicans in Congress, it seems to be much, much higher.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Some of the proposals for the forthcoming budget raise income cutoff levels to as high as $2.5 million per year.</p><hr><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The House is considering allowing state and local tax deductions of as much as $40,000 for people making up to $500,000, Axios' <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/mike-johnson-salt-deduction-cap-trump-taxes" target="_blank">Hans Nichols</a> reported this week, a sign that some blue-state Republicans consider $500,000 to be a middle-class income.</p><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>President Trump considers an annual income of $1 million too modest to justify higher <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/trumps-millionaires-tax-rates-mike-johnson" target="_blank">income taxes</a>, per Nichols, but is fine with the idea once household income reaches $2.5 million.</p><ul><li>The current incarnation of the bill also raises the level at which the estate tax starts being levied from $15 million to $30 million.</li></ul><p><strong>Where it stands: </strong>To be in <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t05.htm" target="_blank">the top 10%</a> of individual earners, a U.S. worker has to earn $2,905 per week, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is $150,000 per year.</p><ul><li>To be in <a href="https://dqydj.com/household-income-percentile-calculator/" target="_blank">the top 10%</a> of households in 2024, you had to earn $235,000.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/16/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/" target="_blank">middle class</a> tops out at $169,800 for a family of three in 2022 dollars, which is $188,400 in 2025 dollars, according to Pew Research Center.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Some government policies only apply to people making less than a certain amount, on the grounds that the rich are already comfortable enough not to need any extra help from Uncle Sam.</p><ul><li>Looking at where that line gets drawn provides an indicator of where the upper middle class ends and the upper class begins, at least in the eyes of Congress.</li></ul><p><strong>Flashback: </strong>Trump, in his first term, sent out stimulus checks to those making $198,000 per year or less for married households filing jointly.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">The week before President Donald Trump unveiled bruising new tariffs that sent the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/us-stocks-dow-nasdaq-sp-plummet-trump-tariffs-rcna199476">stock market plummeting</a>, a key official in the agency that shapes his administration’s trade policy sold off as much as $30,000 of stock. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">Two days before that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/02/business/trump-tariffs-liberation-day">so-called “Liberation Day”</a> announcement on April 2, a State Department official sold as much as $50,000 in stock, then bought a similar investment as prices fell.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">And just before Trump made another significant tariff announcement, a White House lawyer sold shares in nine companies, records show. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">More than a dozen high-ranking executive branch officials and congressional aides have made well-timed trades since Trump took office in January, most of them selling stock before the market plunged amid fears that Trump’s tariffs would set off a global trade war, according to a ProPublica review of disclosures across the government.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.4">All of the trades came shortly before a significant government announcement or development that could influence stock prices. Some who sold individual stocks or broader market funds used their earnings to buy investments that are generally less risky, such as bonds or treasuries. Others appear to have kept their money in cash. In one case unrelated to tariffs, records show that a congressional aide bought stock in two mining companies shortly before a key Senate committee approved a bill written by his boss that would help the firms.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.5">Using nonpublic information learned at work to trade securities could violate the law. But even if such actions aren’t influenced by insider knowledge, ethics experts warn that trading stock while the federal government’s actions move markets can create the appearance of impropriety. The recent trades by government officials, they said, underscore that there should be tighter rules on how, or if, federal employees can trade securities.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.6">“The executive branch is routinely engaged in activities that will move the market,” said Tyler Gellasch, who, as a congressional aide, helped write the law on insider trading by government officials and now runs a nonprofit focused on transparency and ethics in capital markets. “I don’t think members of Congress and executive branch officials should be trading securities. To the extent they have investment holdings, it should be managed by someone else outside their purview. The temptation to put their own personal self-interest ahead of their duties to the country is just too high.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">There is no evidence that the trades by government officials identified by ProPublica were informed by nonpublic information. Still, when government officials trade stock at opportune times, Gellasch said, even if it was based on luck and not inside information, it undermines trust in government and the markets</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">“It then becomes a thing where our markets look rigged,” he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">In response to questions from ProPublica, the officials who made the trades either said they had no insider information that would help them time their decisions or did not respond to questions about the transactions. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.3">Questions about trades based on nonpublic information have swirled around Congress for years and began anew after Trump’s tariffs announcements led to wild swings in the market. Lawmakers’ trades are automatically posted online and, after multiple congressional stock-trading scandals, are widely scrutinized as soon as they become public. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.4">But less attention is paid to the trades of executive branch employees and congressional aides whose work could give them access to confidential information likely to influence markets once made public.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.5">Last week, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/pam-bondi-trump-media-stock-tariffs">ProPublica reported</a> that Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/102E39A4A731A68785258C8A002C7208/$FILE/Pam-Bondi-05.05.2025-278T.pdf">sold between $1 million and $5 million worth</a> of shares of <a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/">Trump Media</a>, the president’s social media company, on April 2. After the market closed that day, Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs, sending the market reeling. Bondi’s <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/FC3B6F6F496E257B85258C150032F344/$FILE/Bondi,%20Pam%20%20finalEA.pdf">ethics agreement</a> required her to sell by early May, but why she sold on that date is unclear. She has yet to answer questions about the trades, and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.6">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sean-duffy-stock-sales-trump-tariffs">ProPublica reported</a> that Sean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary, <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/FED6F4F51D33882F85258C8A002C760E/$FILE/Sean-Duffy-04.23.2025-278T.pdf">sold shares in almost three dozen companies</a> on Feb. 11, two days before Trump announced plans to institute wide-ranging “reciprocal” tariffs. A Transportation Department spokesperson said Duffy’s account manager made the trades and that Duffy had no input on the timing.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.7">Using insider government information to buy or sell securities could violate the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK, Act. But no cases have ever been brought under the law, and some legal experts have doubts it would hold up to scrutiny from the courts, which in recent years have generally narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.8">Thousands of government employees are required to file disclosure forms if they sell or buy securities worth more than $1,000. In many cases, the records are available only in person in Washington, D.C., or through a records request. The documents do not include exact amounts bought or sold but instead provide a broad range for the totals of each transaction.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.9">ProPublica examined hundreds of records for trades shortly before major tariff announcements or other key government decisions. Trump, of course, repeatedly said on the campaign trail that he intended to institute dramatic tariffs on foreign imports. But during the first weeks of his term, investors were not panic selling, seeming to assume that his campaign promises were bluster. Several tariff announcements by Trump early on shook the markets, but it wasn’t until he detailed his new tariffs on April 2 that stocks dived. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.10">Among those who sold securities before one of Trump’s main tariff announcements was Tobias Dorsey. Dorsey, a lawyer in the executive branch since the Obama administration, was named acting general counsel for the White House’s Office of Administration in January, when Trump was inaugurated. The division provides a range of services, including research and legal counseling across the president’s staff, including the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which helps craft trade policy. In his LinkedIn bio, Dorsey describes his duties since 2022 as giving “expert advice on a wide range of legal and policy matters to help White House officials achieve their policy goals.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.11">On Feb. 25 and 26, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950827-tobias-dorsey-03272025-278t/">disclosure records show</a>, Dorsey unloaded shares of an index fund and nine companies, including cleaning products manufacturer Clorox and engineering firm Emerson Electric. The total dollar figure for the sales was between $12,000 and $180,000. (He purchased one stock, defense contractor Palantir, which was selling for a bargain after recently plummeting on news of Pentagon budget cuts.) </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.12">At the time of Dorsey’s trades, investors were still largely in denial that Trump was going to go through with the massive tariffs he had promised during the campaign. But the next morning, Trump posted on social media that significant tariffs on Mexico and Canada “will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled” in several days, and that “China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.13">The S&amp;P 500, a stock index that tracks a wide swath of the market, fell almost 2% that day alone and ultimately dropped nearly 18% in six weeks.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.14">In an interview, Dorsey said the sale was made by his wife from an account belonging to her. He said she decided to sell around $20,000 worth of shares so they could make tuition payments and that he had no nonpublic information on the impending tariff announcements. The kind of work he does as a career employee, he said, focuses not on public policy, but on how the White House operates, including personnel, workplace technology, contracts and records issues.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.15">“I’m not advising Stephen Miller or Peter Navarro,” he said, referring to top policy advisers to the president. “I’m advising the people running the campus. … I don’t have access to any sensitive political information.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.16">Another well-timed set of transactions was made by Marshall Stallings, the director of intergovernmental affairs and public engagement for Trump’s Trade Representative. The office helps shape the White House’s trade policy and negotiates trade deals with foreign governments.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.17">On March 25 and 27, Stallings sold between $2,000 and $30,000 of stock in retail giant Target and mining company Freeport-McMoRan. The sales appear to have been an abrupt U-turn. He had purchased the shares less than a week earlier. Days after Stallings’ sales, Trump unveiled his most dramatic tariffs. Target stock fell 17%. Freeport-McMoRan fell 25%. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.18">Stallings and the Trade Representative’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.19">A longtime State Department official, Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath, who until April was ambassador to Peru, also appeared to make a bet against the stock market. On March 24 and 25, she <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950826-stephanie-f-syptak-ramnath-04022025-278t/">sold between $255,000 and $650,000</a> in stocks, and bought between $265,000 and $650,000 in bond and treasury funds (along with $50,000 to $100,000 in stocks). Then, on March 31, two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, she sold between $15,000 and $50,000 of a broad-based stock fund. When the market started to plummet, she bought back the same dollar range in another stock fund. Syptak-Ramnath said she did not have any information about the administration's decisions beyond what was publicly available. The trades, she said, were “undertaken as a result of family obligations” and in “response to a changing economy.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.20">A second longtime State Department official, Gautam Rana, who is now ambassador to Slovakia, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950828-gautam-a-rana-04082025-278t/">sold between $830,000 and $1.7 million</a> worth of stock on March 19, a week before Trump declared new tariffs on cars and two weeks before his “Liberation Day” announcement. The shares he sold were largely broad-based index funds. Rana declined to comment for this story.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.21">Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer, said executive branch employees who don’t have nonpublic information and want to trade stock should consult with ethics officials before doing so, thereby allowing an independent third party to assess their actions.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.22">“If you trade and you don’t seek advice in advance, you kind of do it at your own risk, and if you’re asked about it, you have to hope there aren’t factors that make someone question your motivations,” Canter said. “If you seek ethics official advice, you have some cover.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.23">Executive branch employees are barred from taking government actions that would narrowly benefit them personally, and some are required to sell stock in companies and industries they have purview over in their jobs. But like members of Congress, they are allowed to trade securities. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.24">Since Trump’s tariff announcements and walkbacks began causing fluctuations in the market, questions have been raised about whether anyone has profited off advance notice of the moves. After Trump unexpectedly rolled back some of his tariffs in early April, causing stocks to surge, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned on social media that “any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.25">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene bought between $21,000 and $315,000 of stock the day before and the day of the announcement. In a statement, Greene said a financial adviser controls her investments: “Since my portfolio manager makes my trades for me, I usually find out about them when the media asks.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.26">ProPublica’s review of disclosures also found trades by congressional aides that took place before the market tumbled. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.27">Michael Platt, a veteran Republican staffer who served in the Commerce Department during Trump’s first term and now works for the House committee that handles administrative matters for the chamber, restructured his portfolio in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950851-platt-michael-ptr-2025-04-10/">March</a>. An account under his wife’s name sold off between $96,000 and $390,000 in mostly American companies, and purchased at least $45,000 in foreign stocks and at least $15,000 in an American and Canadian energy index fund. Some stock forecasters considered international markets a relatively safe haven if Trump went through with his tariffs. Platt did not respond to requests for comment.  </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.28">Stephanie Trifone, a Senate Judiciary Committee aide, sold stock in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950842-trifone-stephanie-ptr-2025-05-12/">mid-March</a> and bought at least $50,000 in treasuries. A spokesperson for the committee’s Democratic minority said Trifone had no nonpublic information about the tariffs and her trades were conducted by a financial adviser without her input. Kevin Wheeler, a staffer for the Senate Appropriations Committee, made a similar move. In late February, he and his spouse <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950844-wheeler-kevin-ptr-2025-05-05/">offloaded between $18,000 and $270,000</a> in funds composed almost entirely of stocks and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950849-wheeler-kevin-ptr-2025-03-28/">bought between $50,000 and $225,000 in bonds</a>. A spokesperson for the Appropriation Committee’s Republican majority said Wheeler had no nonpublic information about Trump’s tariff plans and that a financial planner made the trades after advising Wheeler to take a more conservative approach with his portfolio.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.29">Another staffer, Ryan White, chief of staff to Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950840-white-ryan-ptr-2025-04-19/">bought shares worth between $2,000 and $30,000</a> in two precious metals mining companies <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950840-white-ryan-ptr-2025-04-19/">two days</a> before Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement. He <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950840-white-ryan-ptr-2025-04-19/">continued buying more shares</a> in the companies, Hecla Mining and Coeur Mining, in the following days. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.30">Precious metals can be a safe haven during a bear market turn, but those stocks, like the rest of the market, declined after Trump’s tariff announcements. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.31">Two days after White’s last purchase in April of the mining companies’ shares, however, the firms got some good news. A bill White’s boss introduced to make it easier for mining companies like Hecla and Coeur to operate on public lands was approved by a Senate committee, an important step in passing a bill. (White <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950845-white-ryan-ptr-2025-05-14/">added to his Hecla shares</a> earlier this month and sold his stake in Coeur.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.32">White told ProPublica that “all required reporting and ethics rules were followed.” Any suggestion that the committee passing the bill played a role in his stock purchases “is a stretch and patently false,” he said, adding that the legislation “has not become law and even if it does, would take decades to have any appreciable impact.”</p>

Title: Chicago Police Dismissed a Recruit’s Claims That a Colleague Sexually Assaulted Her. Then He was Accused Again and Again.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Alexus Byrd-Maxey had just finished her second month at the Chicago police academy, well on her way to fulfilling her childhood dream.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.1">The South Side native wanted to become a detective so she could bring closure to families who have lost loved ones to homicides by arresting those responsible.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.2">Byrd-Maxey, then 26, was proud of herself for making it this far: completing college classes, applying to the academy multiple times, passing a background check and physical tests. She was delighted to be part of the academy despite the sacrifices it required, including leaving her toddler son most mornings at 5 a.m. and having her mom spend thousands to buy her new uniforms and equipment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.3">“Actually sitting in those chairs at the academy was very rewarding,” she said. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.4">But on March 17, 2023, an encounter with a fellow recruit derailed that dream. On that day, she was leaning over a classmate’s computer, helping him log on to do their lesson. As another recruit walked behind her, she said she felt his hands on her waist and his body pressed up against her. He was close enough, she told reporters, that she felt “his penis on my butt.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.5">She recalled that she confronted him immediately — hoping to hear remorse in his voice. Instead, she said, she saw him smirk. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.6">“That’s when I knew,” she said. “You’re not sorry.”</p>
        
    
                    
    
        <p>
            <strong><a href="https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/sexual-assault-misconduct-chicago-police-callout">Help Us Report on Sexual Assault and Misconduct by the Chicago Police Department</a></strong>
        </p>

    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">In the days that followed, Byrd-Maxey wrestled with how to report her fellow recruit, a man named Eric Tabb, or whether to let it go. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1">At the same time, police department investigative records show, Tabb started telling other recruits that Byrd-Maxey had overreacted and that he had only tapped her on the shoulder so he could get to his seat. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.2">The following week, when Byrd-Maxey reported the incident to her class leader, he talked to fellow recruits and they downplayed the encounter. A recruit who allegedly witnessed the incident and was friends with Tabb later told investigators that Byrd-Maxey was “trying to victimize herself.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.3">The academy instructor never filed a sexual misconduct complaint. Two and a half weeks later, Byrd-Maxey was fired from the academy for supposedly cursing and using gang language — allegations she has denied. Tabb soon became an officer and began patrolling streets.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.4">But he didn’t last long.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.5">Eight months after Byrd-Maxey was fired, Tabb was arrested for allegedly grabbing a fellow officer’s genitals repeatedly over her uniform after roll call in their police precinct. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.6">That woman, too, had been in the academy with Byrd-Maxey. Two additional female recruits also have said Tabb assaulted them, and witnesses allege yet another was assaulted but did not report it, meaning five of 17 women in his academy class have given similar accounts, investigative files show. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.7">Tabb now faces multiple felony charges, including aggravated criminal sexual abuse. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.8">He has pleaded not guilty, and the criminal case is ongoing. He declined to comment.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Police department records, including interviews and investigative files obtained by the Invisible Institute and ProPublica, together with court records, highlight how police officials failed to intervene while Tabb was at the academy and head off potential harm to other women. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.1">Reporters identified 14 officers who disciplinary records suggest may be repeat offenders, having been accused of sexual assault in the last decade and of at least one other incident of sexual misconduct. Five of those officers faced criminal charges and were convicted, in some cases pleading to a lesser offense that was not a sex crime, and three others have ongoing criminal cases. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.2">In reviewing more than 300 sexual misconduct and assault complaints against Chicago police officers, the Invisible Institute and ProPublica found a pattern of the department failing to vigorously investigate accusations of sexual assault by officers, whether those complaints were lodged by fellow cops or members of the public. The claims were often downplayed or ignored, sometimes allowing officers to abuse again and again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.3">A 2017 U.S. Department of Justice investigation into Chicago police found officers frequently minimized the seriousness of sexual misconduct accusations against colleagues and didn’t employ best-practice investigative techniques. Police, the investigation found, closed cases without conducting full investigations. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.4">Police spokesperson Don Terry declined requests for an interview but said in a statement that the department “takes all allegations of sexual assault seriously, including allegations against CPD members.” He said the department has “zero tolerance for sexual misconduct and any member in violation will be held accountable.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.5">He also said the department works with victim advocacy groups “to assist in the appropriate reporting of sexual assault allegations against department members in a way that eliminates barriers to reporting and provides support services to the survivors.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">That Tabb allegedly assaulted women while training to become a police officer is particularly troubling. The police academy is where aspiring officers learn the department’s culture. Recruits get their first lessons in how officers should behave in uniform — and out of it. They also have fewer job protections while undergoing their academy training, so they can be easily dismissed if they break the rules. Four other academy recruits have filed sexual misconduct or harassment complaints in the last four years. Records show three of the complaints ended in no discipline for the accused officer and one is still ongoing. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.1">“I think of it as behavior that you’re sort of taught in the first few years on the job, starting with your field training officer, what you can get away with,” said Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University who has done extensive research on police misconduct and created a national database of officer arrests. “They learn that it’s accepted behavior within that culture, within that squad, or that shift, quite often. And I do think that it’s behaviors that escalate.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.2">In June 2023, a little over two months after Byrd-Maxey was kicked out of the academy, the department implemented its first sexual misconduct policy, one it had been working on before she began her training.</p>

A Pattern of Missed Opportunities
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">The Chicago Police Department has a long history of failing to identify and deal with patterns of troubling behavior within its ranks. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.1">Officers who stole from suspects were able to do so repeatedly before getting caught. Detectives who coerced confessions, sending innocent people to prison and costing the city tens of millions of dollars in legal settlements, did so without ever being disciplined. And some cops who abused and tortured Chicagoans did so for years before they were stopped.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.2">This failure of the department to police its own officers has also had devastating consequences for people who have accused officers of sexual assault or harassment. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.3">In 2019, then-Superintendent Eddie Johnson praised the department’s internal investigation of 13-year police veteran Officer Corey Deanes, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by four women. He called it a “testament to our ability to police ourselves.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">But what Johnson didn’t mention was that the department allowed Deanes to police the city’s streets for nearly a year despite two allegations of sexual misconduct. It took the city’s civilian police oversight agency to identify his behavior and stop him. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.1">Deanes was suspended for seven days in 2011 for sexually harassing a woman during a traffic stop. He insisted on getting her phone number, then called or texted nearly 30 times. He told investigators he had no official reason to pull the woman over but did so because he wanted to talk to her. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.2">Six years later, in August 2017, he again was accused of abusing his position while pulling over a 23-year-old woman during a traffic stop. Deanes, according to internal affairs records, made inappropriate comments to her and threatened to write the woman a ticket if she did not give him her phone number. Then Deanes allegedly hugged her and, though she resisted, touched her buttocks before leaving without giving her a ticket. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.3">The woman reported the incident to the Chicago police and to the Independent Police Review Authority, the civilian oversight agency at the time. Police records and a lawsuit brought by the woman indicate it took police investigators more than a year to interview her, and the department lost an opportunity to get Deanes off the streets. The city settled the woman’s lawsuit for $100,000.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.4">In July 2018, another Chicago woman reported Deanes. She had called 911 for help after arriving home late at night and finding a stranger on her porch. Deanes, who responded to the call, allegedly asked her personal questions, commented on her body and touched her inappropriately, according to internal affairs records.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.5">“I felt so violated,” the woman, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told Invisible Institute and ProPublica. “I called you for help and I got harassed. That is not OK.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.6">The woman reported the incident to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, the latest iteration of the review board. Launched in 2017 as part of a wider series of reforms, COPA and its new leaders hoped to bring an additional focus to investigating claims of domestic violence and sexual assault committed by officers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.7">Yet another woman filed a complaint against Deanes two weeks after the incident with the 911 call. This time, COPA identified a pattern. Andrea Kersten, then COPA’s head of investigations, notified the police department’s Bureau of Internal Affairs about the three incidents and pushed for a criminal investigation. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.8">Deanes was arrested in May 2019 and charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery, one felony count of aggravated battery, and three felony counts of official misconduct for the three separate incidents. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor battery in 2020 and received two years probation. He was stripped of his Illinois state certification, preventing him from working as a cop.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">The woman who encountered Deanes after the 911 call said she’s disappointed that it took so long for the department to take action. “Police will have each other’s backs no matter what heinous things they do,” she said. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.1">Deanes declined to comment for this story. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.2">COPA has taken steps to improve its handling of sexual misconduct cases to identify officers who repeatedly engage in misconduct. Under Kersten’s leadership, the agency created a Special Victims Squad of trained investigators in 2019 to pursue these cases, including those with limited evidence beyond the accuser’s word. COPA also entered into an agreement that allowed other agencies to conduct joint interviews with victims to enhance collaboration and to reduce the risk of retraumatizing victims by limiting retellings of their assault. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.3">Kersten stepped down as the head of COPA in February after facing a possible no-confidence vote from an oversight board and ongoing lawsuits against <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/illinois/ilndce/1:2024cv07376/463117">Kersten and COPA.</a> A lawsuit filed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing Chicago police officers, alleged that COPA and Kersten have exhibited an anti-police bias that unfairly affects investigations and how officers are disciplined. A federal judge dismissed the suit in April.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Kersten declined to comment for this story, but in her resignation letter she disputed the claims against her. COPA’s interim chief administrator said the agency remains committed to pursuing investigations of sexual misconduct. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.1">“We are working on growing our SVS section to a fuller unit with more staff who will receive specialized training to handle these investigations,” the administrator, LaKenya White, said in a statement. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.2">While COPA participated in the investigation into Byrd-Maxey’s claims, internal affairs led the criminal investigation into the matter.</p>

“I’m Not Going Nowhere.”
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">Last fall, Alexus Byrd-Maxey had come to accept what she called God’s will — that she would not become a Chicago police officer. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.1">Since being fired from the academy, she had struggled with depression and anxiety as she tried to rebuild her life.

            Byrd-Maxey’s police equipment and uniform from her time as a police recruit
    
            (Jamie Kelter Davis for ProPublica)
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">It wasn’t long after Byrd-Maxey tried to alert the academy about Tabb that a second incident occurred. At the end of August 2023, Tabb attended a birthday celebration at a Wrigleyville bar with other recruits. He joined a female recruit on the dance floor and, according to investigative reports and court records, touched her breast, buttock and crotch over her clothes and also grabbed her face and tried to kiss her. He was so aggressive, a witness told investigators, that a mutual friend had to intervene to get him away from the recruit. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.1">A few days later, according to investigative files and court records, Tabb attended a “star party,” an unofficial celebration for graduating recruits receiving their badge number. Another recruit told investigators he saw Tabb grabbing a third female recruit’s genitals over her clothes. The recruit’s boyfriend confronted Tabb, according to a witness. That same night, Tabb touched a fourth recruit’s buttocks, according to interviews with police investigators and court records. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.2">In the immediate aftermath, the three women said nothing, and soon Tabb was officially on the force.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">After about three months, a fifth female officer accused Tabb of touching her crotch over her uniform several times when she stood up after roll call to adjust her duty belt.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.1">The woman went to her supervisor despite her fears. “I was afraid that any type of confrontation or anything would not work out for me,” she later told investigators. “I felt powerless,” the woman said, crying. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.2">She said Tabb grabbed her crotch a second time.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.3">“He sat back in his chair and he had a slight smile on his face with his hand up to his chin,” she said in a recorded interview with investigators. “It looked to me like, I don’t know, like he was proud of what he did.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.4">During the investigation into that incident, officials uncovered the allegations against Tabb that involved his off-duty behavior toward recruits. Two of the three recruits stepped forward to report Tabb’s behavior because they said they wanted to support the final alleged victim.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Even though Byrd-Maxey had been the first to report his behavior, no one contacted her for 15 months about the criminal case against Tabb. When she learned about it, she decided to attend his next court hearing. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.1">On a Tuesday morning in March, Byrd-Maxey entered the busy Cook County criminal courthouse with her mom, Jauntaunne Byrd-Horne. They walked past the black Doric columns and the tall golden lamps on their way to a courtroom, where a hearing was scheduled in Tabb’s case. For the first time in nearly two years, she was going to see him.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.2">Her mom made herself a T-shirt to ensure her daughter’s pain was acknowledged. In bold white letters against a black background, the front of the shirt read: “What about Tabb’s first police academy victim 03/17/2023?”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.3">Byrd-Maxey and her mother sat in the courtroom’s first row. A few minutes later, Tabb arrived with his parents and sat behind them. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.4">At issue was a request from prosecutors asking to have the additional allegations related to off-duty incidents considered as evidence of a pattern of behavior: similar victims, similar assaults. Dan Herbert, Tabb’s defense attorney, said his client was innocent. He tried to blame Byrd-Maxey for the claims involving all the off-duty recruits, implying she had a grudge against Tabb.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Records show that before she was fired, Byrd-Maxey tried to report Tabb multiple times. She talked to her class leader — a fellow recruit who is put in a leadership position — on the Monday following the Friday incident. Records show the class leader discussed the incident with superiors and placed more emphasis on Tabb’s version, which was supported by other recruits. No one filed an official complaint. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.1">Almost three weeks later, conflict erupted in class. Byrd-Maxey claimed Tabb verbally attacked her, and Tabb accused her of doing the same, records show. After class, Byrd-Maxey said, she went to her instructor to tell him about the incident in the computer lab. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.2">Byrd-Maxey was fired the next day, accused of saying “shut your bitch ass up” in class and using gang-related language. Though their names were redacted, investigative files show seven recruits, including Tabb, filed complaints against Byrd-Maxey for engaging in this behavior. She denies the allegations.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">The next day, Byrd-Maxey returned to the police academy to file the sexual misconduct complaint herself. She also accused two instructors of wrongful termination. During that investigation, several recruits sided with Tabb, including three who told investigators they were in the computer lab at the time.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.1">By the time internal affairs cleared Tabb of Byrd-Maxey’s complaint on Sept. 20, 2023, he had allegedly assaulted three other women from his academy class. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.2">During the court hearing, Tabb’s attorney attacked the credibility of those officers for not reporting the alleged abuse the moment it happened. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.3">“They’re police officers. They have a duty to report misconduct,” Herbert said. “And they’re probationary police officers, which as the court well knows, they can be fired for any reason, unless it’s an illegal reason. They can be fired for not reporting misconduct. I think that’s what happened in this case.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.4">After the hearing, Byrd-Maxey spotted Tabb in the courthouse lobby. She locked eyes with him as their paths crossed.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">“I’m here. I’m not going nowhere,” she said afterward. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.1">Byrd-Maxey and her mother embraced outside the courthouse, an acknowledgment of the toll reporting Tabb had taken on them both. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.2">Yet she doesn’t regret it. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.3">“I wouldn’t change anything, even though it cost me mentally and financially,” she said. “I wouldn’t change it because, at the end of the day, I had the right motive to be heard and to avoid this from happening again.”</p>

    Methodology
<p>Invisible Institute reporters spent over a year identifying allegations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct by Chicago police officers, then created a database from those allegations. We reviewed hundreds of complaints obtained through public records requests and a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Reporters obtained investigative files from the Chicago Police Department’s Bureau of Internal Affairs, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and its predecessor agency, the Independent Police Review Authority. Reporters read the original investigative files, examined evidence and reviewed lawsuits, court records and media accounts. </p>
<p>The Invisible Institute and ProPublica compiled a dataset of more than 300 complaints after excluding dozens of cases where body camera footage contradicted the allegation, where non-police witnesses affirmed the police account, or where a secondhand allegation was not corroborated.</p>
<p>This investigation would not be possible without previous litigation that pushed for disciplinary records to be open to the public despite resistance from the city. Those lawsuits include <a href="https://invisible.institute/bond-v-utreras-intervention">Bond v. Utreras</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2020/07/17/commentary-a-proposed-settlement-would-broadside-police-accountability-that-should-never-happen/">Green v. Chicago Police Department</a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/jamie_kalven_diane_bond_chicago_police_misconduct_foia.php">Kalven v. Chicago</a>, which was brought by Jamie Kalven, founder of the Invisible Institute, and led to the publication of police misconduct complaints on the <a href="http://cpdp.co">Civic Police Data Project</a> site.</p>

Title: Unlearning or Obfuscating? Jogging the Memory of Unlearned LLMs via Benign Relearning
Description: Machine unlearning is a promising approach to mitigate undesirable memorization of training data in ML models. In this post, we will discuss our work (which appeared at ICLR 2025) demonstrating that existing approaches for unlearning in LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to a simple set of benign relearning attacks: With access to only a small and potentially loosely related set of data, we find that we can “jog” the memory of unlearned models to reverse the effects of unlearning.  For example, we show that relearning on public medical articles can lead an unlearned LLM to output harmful knowledge about bioweapons, and relearning general wiki information about the book series Harry Potter can force the model to output verbatim memorized text. We formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline, explore the attack across three popular unlearning benchmarks, and discuss future directions and guidelines that result from our study. Our work offers a cautionary tale to the unlearning community—showing that current approximate unlearning methods simply suppress the model outputs and fail to robustly forget target knowledge in the LLMs. What is Machine Unlearning and how can it be attacked? The initial concept of machine unlearning was motivated by GDPR regulations around the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;, [&#8230;]

dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">「這使得在面對情感衝突時，無法求助親友或專業支持，獨自承受情感與社會的雙重壓力，宛如孤島。」</p></div><div dir="ltr" class="bbc-19j92fr ebmt73l0"><p dir="ltr" class="bbc-w2hm1d e17g058b0">陳政沂解釋，台灣對「離婚」標籤仍存負面觀感，同志離婚身份的揭露常伴隨「婚姻失敗者」與「同志身份」邊緣的雙重污名。因此，許多人為避免負面評價或被深究，離婚後對外人或約會時採取隱晦（discreet）的溝通策略，以「前女友」或「分手」替代前任或離婚。此外，陳先生還觀察到，歐美同志伴侶較少受傳統文化束縛。 相反地，與異性戀伴侶雷同，台灣同志走入婚姻關係前，許多人內化的華人價值觀，例如金錢觀或緊密的家人關係仍會影響婚姻關係及伴侶溝通。他舉例說，有同志便向他表示婚前單身時不大需要或選擇不在意對方的家人，婚後卻需參與對方家庭活動，如過年團聚等互動，開始感到壓力，甚至導致婚姻問題。</p></div><section role="region" aria-label="更多相關內容"

Title:  日本通胀压力加剧，关键指标创两年新高 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">日本通胀又飙升了，关键通胀指标创下两年高位，日本央行面临难题。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月23日，日本周五公布的数据显示，4月不包括新鲜食品在内的核心消费者价格指数（CPI）同比上涨3.5%，创下2023年1月以来最高，较3月份的3.2%进一步攀升，也超过了经济学家预期的3.4%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/ec77ddb1-85fe-40d2-8ee3-84b0a144e5e6.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="677" data-wscnw="1173"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在经济不确定性加剧的大背景下，最新的通胀数据给日本央行决策者带来了更多挑战。Capital Economics亚太区负责人Marcel Thieliant预计，<strong>持续的通胀压力将促使日本央行在今年10月再次加息。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">数据公布之后，日元兑美元汇率上涨0.15%至143.80，目前日元延续涨势，截止发稿，美元/日元报143.51，跌0.36%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9fbf313d-fa18-43e0-9af5-94028e452b24.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="755" data-wscnw="1150"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">通胀持续高于目标，决策者面临两难</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">日本最新通胀数据显示，日本4月整体通胀率同比上涨3.6%，与上个月持平，这意味着通胀率已经连续三年多时间高于日本央行2%的目标水平。而另一项剔除了能源成本的核心物价指数上涨3.0%，这是一年多来首次触及这一水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，更令人震惊的是，数据显示，<strong>日本4月大米价格同比暴涨98.4%，创下自1971年有可比数据以来的历史最大涨幅</strong>，同时也是连续7个月刷新历史最高涨幅。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">虽然日本央行行长植田和男此前已表示，鉴于价格走势，央行有意进一步加息，但他同时也强调需要密切关注美国关税政策的影响。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在通胀飙升之际，日本经济还面临来自特朗普新政府的严峻外部挑战。除非与美国达成协议，否则日本将面临10%的基础关税，以及将于7月生效的24%的&#34;对等&#34;关税。此外，日本也是特朗普对汽车、钢铁和铝产品征收25%关税政策的主要受害者之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">关于日美关税的最新消息，据<span style="color: #1482f0;"><a style="color: #1482f0;" href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">华尔街见闻此前提及</a></span>，日本首相石破茂5月23日表示与特朗普就关税议题通话45分钟。此次通话中石破茂向特朗普解释了日本对美国关税的立场。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1831806179668530408&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">根据环球时报</a>，日本首相石破茂原计划在6月与美国就关税问题达成协议，但目前已转为以7月达成协议为目标。石破茂表示，是特朗普要求今天通电话的，感受到特朗普和我有着广泛的共识。特朗普没有就关税议题发表任何具体言论，但日本在关税问题上的立场没有改变，将继续寻求取消额外的美国关税。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">面临通胀压力和经济不确定的两难局面，有分析指出，如果通胀持续高于预期，日本央行可能在今年10月再次加息，这将进一步推高日元汇率，影响日本出口导向型企业的盈利前景。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，Sompo Institute Plus经济学家Masato Koike预测，由于原油价格下降和日元升值，未来几个月核心通胀将会缓和。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">他还指出，美国关税可能导致食品供应过剩，反而降低食品价格。此外，日本政府计划在夏季恢复对电力和燃气账单的补贴也将对通胀产生下行压力。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  欧美谈判火药味浓！美国施压升级，要求“单方面让步”，否则20%关税无法避免 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">欧美贸易谈判进展甚微，特朗普贸易团队向欧盟施压：要么单方面降低关税，要么面对20%惩罚性关税。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">周五，据媒体援引知情人士消息，美国贸易代表Jamieson Greer准备告知欧盟贸易官员Maroš Šefčovič，欧盟最近分享的“解释性说明”远未达到美方期望。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>具体来看，美国对欧盟仅提供相互关税削减而非单方面降低关税感到不满</strong>，尤其是在其他一些贸易伙伴已向华盛顿提出类似单方面让步的背景下。更令美方不悦的是，<strong>欧盟未将其提议的数字税作为谈判要点，</strong>而这正是美国的明确要求。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Greer和Šefčovič计划下月在巴黎会面，这被视为双方能否避免贸易争端升级的关键。</strong>尽管欧美已开始交换谈判文件，但双方在实质问题上进展甚微。<a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?&amp;item_id=18407057327267715095&amp;t=1746833150627&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;track_id=FEAF0A48-ACA5-49A0-8A39-72A0992F1F1A_769673595803&amp;share_to=qq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">据央视新闻此前报道</a>，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩当地时间9日在布鲁塞尔表示，在欧美能够进行具体的贸易谈判之前，她不会前往华盛顿会见美国总统特朗普。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">一位了解谈判情况的第三方官员对达成避免达成协议并不乐观，直言：</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">交换信函不是真正的进展，我们仍然没有真正取得任何进展。</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-testid="stHeadingWithActionElements">
<h2 id="f62bfdc2">英国模式难以复制，欧盟谈判面临更大压力</h2>
<p>欧盟作为美国最大的贸易伙伴之一，目前面临艰难抉择：要么接受美方单方面降低关税的要求，要么拒绝让步并冒险面临美国施加的高额关税，这将对欧洲经济造成严重打击。</p>
</div>
<p>英国已与美国达成协议，虽然维持了10%的&#34;对等&#34;关税税率，但为其钢铁出口争取到了免关税配额，并为10万辆汽车获得了10%的较低税率。作为交换，英国必须允许更多美国乙醇和牛肉进口。</p>
<p>相比之下，美国对大多数欧盟商品征收20%的&#34;对等&#34;税率，但将其减半至7月8日以留出谈判时间。同时，美国保持对钢铁、铝和汽车零部件25%的税率水平，并承诺对药品、半导体和其他商品采取类似行动。</p>
<p>一些欧盟外交官认为，美国在任何协议中都会维持10%作为基准税率——这一前景让许多欧盟贸易部长表示将进行报复。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">欧盟回应策略：合作协议对抗单边要求</h2>
<p>据了解欧盟回应的人士透露，欧盟委员会首席贸易官员Sabine Weyand周日告诉各国大使：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>希望“用合作协议来对抗美国的单边要求”，虽然委员会正在考虑进一步的报复措施，但应尽一切努力避免实施。</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>欧盟提议讨论标准互认、简化食品和动物贸易程序，以及如何确保进口商品符合国际劳工权利和环境保护标准——这是美国的一项关键要求。</p>
<p>欧盟贸易发言人Olof Gill表示：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>欧盟的优先事项是寻求与美国达成公平、平衡的协议，这是我们庞大的贸易和投资关系应得的。双方都需要努力解决当前的关税问题，并在共同关心的关键领域进行战略协调。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>然而，面对美方的强硬立场和单边要求，欧盟的合作姿态能否化解这场贸易争端仍存疑问。投资者需密切关注下月巴黎会谈的结果，这将直接影响跨大西洋贸易关系的走向。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  美元贬值多少才能消除贸易逆差？德银：40%！ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">据追风交易台消息，5月22日，德意志银行最新研报指出，美元实际汇率需贬值40%才能使美国贸易逆差归零，而这一目标仅靠关税政策难以实现。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">德意首席经济学家Peter Hooper在报告中分析称，过去15年间，美元实际汇率累计升值约40%，这一趋势由美国财政扩张、货币政策周期及海外储蓄行为变化共同推动。美元实际汇率逆转过去15年的升幅才能消除贸易逆差。</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">若过去15年间美元平均实际汇率40%的升值幅度出现逆转，很可能足以使赤字恢复至零的平衡状态，但这需要的政策手段可能远远超出单纯实施关税的范畴。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">德银研报显示，美国长期贸易赤字的根源与美元实际汇率波动高度相关。</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">长期以来，影响美国外部赤字最稳定的驱动因素始终是美元实际汇率的波动，这种波动源自财政与货币政策基础性转变，以及海外私人部门和政府储蓄行为的变化。</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/9cf3e3b9-90d0-4067-bbce-b1321eb33ba1.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="475" data-wscnw="714"/></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">关税政策“副作用”：有限效果与痛苦代价</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">德银称，在两个条件满足的情况下，<strong>关税确实有缩小贸易逆差的空间：一是贸易伙伴国减少报复性措施；二是美元延续贬值趋势，而非通常伴随关税而来的升值。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，德银警告称，关税政策给美国带来的经济影响——物价上涨和经济增长放缓——将是痛苦的。美国进口商品价格上涨将直接推高通胀压力，而贸易伙伴反制措施可能导致美国出口萎缩。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">因此，若要使逆差回归零，仅靠关税措施显然无法实现这一目标。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hooper预测，随着关税引发的物价压力进一步发酵，公众舆论可能倒逼政策转向。</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">当普通家庭发现日用品价格飙升与就业机会流失的直接关联时，当前政策将面临更大挑战。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">美元指数进入下行通道，大摩：下半年继续贬值</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">近期，美元指数进入下行通道，持续跌至99水平附近，但这仍然距离德银提出的40%跌幅十分遥远。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/afa12223-61d3-4378-8587-61889fdf91f0.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="638" data-wscnw="928"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根士丹利在最新中期策略展望报告中称，<a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">预计下半年美元将继续贬值</a>。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">摩根士丹利认为，关税威胁缓和，降低经济衰退可能性，同时伴随着实质性的货币宽松和监管放松，预计标普500指数到明年二季度将上涨9%，预计10年期美债收益率将降至3.45%。预计美元指数到2026年中将贬值9%至91，因美元强势时代背后有两大核心驱动力正在消失：美国相对其他G10经济体的增长优势和收益率优势将大幅减弱。</p>

Title:  警报尚未解除！日本长债收益率继续高位徘徊 
Description:  <p>在经历动荡一周后，日本长债周五维持高位。由于通胀和财政担忧削弱了对债务的需求，超长期收益率创下历史新高。</p>
<p>日本长债周五维持高位。30年期国债收益率小幅下挫至3.065%，维持高位逼近周三创下的3.185%历史高点，而40年期国债收益率仅较周四创下的3.675%纪录高点小幅回落至3.665%。</p>
<p><img class="wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/e8b68313-f135-4945-82d3-7b134525ba77.jpeg" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="1261" data-wscnw="2035" data-wscnsize="335381"/></p>
<p>基准10年期日本国债收益率则小幅下降0.5个基点至1.555%。2年期收益率上涨0.5个基点至0.735%，5年期收益率则保持不变，为1.03%。这显示出收益率曲线继续陡峭化的趋势，这种情况如持续发展，将使长期融资成本进一步上升。</p>
<p>本轮日本国债收益率飙升主要由两大担忧驱动：一是日益恶化的财政健康状况，二是部分政党提出消费税减税以应对物价上涨的政策建议。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3747438?keyword=%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">此前周二进行的20年期国债拍卖表现疲软</a>，凸显市场吸收新发债券的能力日渐减弱，而这些新债恰恰是为政府财政赤字提供资金所必需的。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#34;超长期国债变得&#39;无法消化&#39;的风险依然存在，&#34;瑞穗(Mizuho)分析师在周五的一份研究报告中警告，&#34;减少超长期债券发行（从而缩短久期）的动力相对强劲。&#34;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">DBS集团研究部的外汇和信贷策略师Chang Wei Liang则表示，除非日本的长期通胀预期在5个月内上升了1%，否则超长期日本国债收益率的飙升意味着日本国债市场提供的平均实际利率显著跃升。这将鼓励日本资产管理公司的资金回流，并进一步支撑日元的复苏。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">周五公布的数据显示，日本4月核心消费者通胀率达到3.5%，创下两年多来的最快年增速，这将继续给日本央行施加更多加息压力。这一数据高于3月份的3.2%，同时也超过经济学家预期的3.4%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Capital Economics亚太区负责人Marcel Thieliant在评论中表示：&#34;尽管公立高中费用下调，4月份的基础通胀仍然保持强劲。我们仍然预计日本央行今年将进一步收紧政策。&#34;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">日本央行行长植田和男周四表示，央行将密切关注市场发展，尤其是在超长期日本国债收益率本周攀升至创纪录高点的背景下。</p>

Title:  动荡期结束的高鑫零售，能否迎来「困境反转」？ 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">高鑫零售（6808.HK）经历了动荡的一年。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2024年3月，前欧尚中国区卖场总经理沈辉接任高鑫零售执行董事兼CEO，阿里出身的林小海卸任。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">不到半年，高鑫零售就被阿里“摆上货架”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025年初，知名PE机构德弘资本以131.38亿元正式将其收入囊中。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">随着交易的完成，原董事会主席黄明端离职，由德弘资本首席执行官华裕能接任。“陆战之王”大润发正式踏入“德弘时代”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">管理层动荡期，传统实体商超行业正经历轰轰烈烈的“爆改”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>商超主流调改方向基本定型，大体可总结为：全渠道发展、会员制仓储式超市、便民社区商业、折扣零售及自有品牌。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高鑫零售在多个方向均有涉猎。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">但对比高调“胖东来化”的一众同行，公司的调改历程稍显低调，大卖场2.0版本问世已是3年之前。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>如今出售事项落定，对高鑫零售意味着动荡告一段落。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">截至3月31日的2025年财报显示，高鑫零售实现归母净利润4.05亿元，较比上年的16亿元亏损大幅扭亏。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">今年3月，高鑫零售CEO沈辉到访胖东来，与于东来直接交流，“胖改”日程似乎走上台前。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">阿里没能扶起的头部商超玩家，将通过何种方式“回归零售本质”，值得市场期待。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">拐点在即？</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">出售交易达成之前，业内就有大润发“卖在黎明之前”的评价。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025上半财年（2024年4月至9月），高鑫零售业绩状况已有改善，营收降幅缩窄至3%，同店销售增速转正至0.3%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">下半财年业绩回暖的态势更为明显。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025财年全年，高鑫零售营收715.52亿元，同比下滑1.4%，较比上年同期13.3%明显收窄，同店销售增速进一步提升至0.6%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">若不考虑供应链业务收缩和闭店损失影响，收入增长约1.6%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>公司整体仍处于降本增效的收缩状态。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025财年，高鑫零售员工减少约2300名，仅雇员福利开支一项就减少约12亿元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">用于新店发展、现有门店改建和数字化改造的资本开支，也比上年同期减少了约3亿元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>不过对存量低效门店的淘汰高峰期，似乎已经过去。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">截至3月31日，高鑫零售旗下门店规模已由3年前巅峰时期的602家降至505家，大卖场总数由490家减少至465家</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025财年，大卖场关店数由去年同期的20家降至8家。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">对负现金流量门店的应计减值损失由12.08亿元大幅降至0.6亿元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>留存的大卖场以“薄利多销”为核心卖点，践行新任管理层提出的“回归零售本质”。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">新推出的自有品牌 “超省” 系列对标竞争对手，强调品类最低价。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">其中包含1.9元的洗洁精、2.7元的护手霜、3元的卫生巾系列、6.7元的苏打饼干、9.9元的洗护发系列。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">性价比的吸引下，大润发线下门店客群企稳、销售温和回暖，线上销售同比增长6%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>即时零售“线上下单、1小时到家”风口正盛的当下，全渠道转型正为连锁商超贡献业绩增量。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大润发对这一领域的探索走在多数同行之前。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">早在七年前，大润发就引入了盒马的悬挂链系统，对超百家店进行新零售改造，将门店订单处理上限从300单提升到了5000单。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025财年，自有APP“大润发优鲜”在高鑫零售线上B2C业务中的占比已达到36.5%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而受限于履约成本的高昂，到家业务对传统商超的利润增长难有助益。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">低价策略虽然刺激消费，但拖累毛利率下滑0.6个百分点至24.1%，全年毛利同比下滑4%。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2025财年，高鑫零售经营利润14.25亿元，经营利润率仅有2%。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">双线谋划</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">比起寻求大卖场沉疴的解决方案，近年来，高鑫零售将更多精力用于打磨真正适配零售需求的全新业态。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">新任管理层基本继承了此前的发展方向。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>难盈利的社区超市小润发被彻底放弃，“第二曲线”目标聚焦于两条路径，一是中超业态“大润发Super”，二是仓储会员店“M会员店”。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“大润发Super”定位面积仅1500平-3000平的社区配套业态，相当于传统大卖场的七分之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SKU精选化，并在5000-8000个SKU中设立1000个长期引流品。增设食堂、儿童乐园等体验区，以打造“社区生活中心”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高鑫零售透露，大润发Super商业模式已基本跑通，同店销售实现5.9%的增长，高于旗下其他业态平均水平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">大润发Super采用模块化设计理念，根据周边居民人数设计卖场的大小、SKU数目乃至进店动线，能快速适配不同类型商圈开店。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">此外每家门店拥有500-1000个SKU的空间，可根据当地需求、商圈特性针对性选品。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">相比于盘踞在华东二、三线城市的M会员店，大润发Super门店分散在全国11个省市，华东区门店占比近三分之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在高鑫零售看来，大润发Super将成为未来扩张及回归高线城市的主要动力。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">不过上一财年，大润发Super新开4家、关店1家，门店总数仅33家，未及大润发的十分之一。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>相比之下，M会员店拓张情况似乎更为明朗。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">过去一年门店新增4家，仅用两年就开出7家门店，会员数超过36万。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">会员费收入同比大增125%，达到3600万元。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">作为少有的本土仓储会员店玩家，M会员店与山姆会员价处在同一水平，价格上并无竞争优势。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">现有的会员店几乎均由原大卖场改造而来，自有物业保障了其在开店速度及成本控制上，较比山姆领先一截。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">高鑫零售M会员商店事业部总经理袁彬表示，M会员商店没有“包袱”，商品毛利与运营成本已经打平。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">整体3000多的SKU中，占比约10％的自有食品与生鲜，却贡献35％的销售额。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">袁彬称，M会员商店尚处于投资阶段，毛利来自于供应链的强大以及销售规模的扩大。“单店规模达到6个亿时，我们就会进入到一个比较良性的阶段。”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>差异化竞争力、自有品牌商品打磨是当前阶段的重点。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>对会员数、续卡的考核要求，被排在在业绩、利润之前。</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">不过头部玩家正携打磨成熟的业态，在高鑫零售的华东大本营加速扩张。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">山姆会员店有望年内落地苏州张家港，成为继晋江、昆山后的第三家县市级门店。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">瞄准社区零售业态的盒马NB，在江浙沪区域开启了大规模店长招募计划；奥乐齐也成功“出沪”，落子苏州、无锡、昆山。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">新一轮的市场竞争将更为激烈，大润发的挑战刚刚开始。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>

Title: Lutnick: Trade deals are coming, higher prices aren't
Description: <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says he's convinced of two things: The U.S. will make a long list of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/lutnick-tariffs-trump" target="_blank">trade deals</a> by mid-summer, and the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/trump-tariffs-china" target="_blank">tariffs</a> forcing those deals won't raise retail prices.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Investors, business leaders and consumers are praying he's right.</p><hr><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>Lutnick, a billionaire Wall Street CEO before entering government, was nothing but optimistic in an interview with Axios' Mike Allen at the Building the Future event in Washington.</p><ul><li>Asked how many of the U.S.'s 18 key trading partners would have a deal by the time a tariff pause ends July 8, he said, "I think most countries, we'll have an idea of what we want to do with them."</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Lutnick is at the forefront of the Trump administration's sweeping efforts to rewrite the rules of global trade, a campaign that has disrupted the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/economy-tariffs-inflation-cleveland-fed-president" target="_blank">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-global-economy-tariffs-imf" target="_blank">international</a> economies and created deep uncertainty for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/11/wall-street-jpmorgan-dimon-outlook-earnings" target="_blank">businesses</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment" target="_blank">consumers</a>.</p><ul><li>The president's argument: The U.S. has been treated unfairly by the world for decades, at the cost of valuable American jobs — a situation that can only be fixed by a more aggressive approach.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Over the last few days, the single most important question about the tariffs has been what they'll do to the American consumer.</p><ul><li>Lutnick recently decried "silly arguments" that tariffs raise prices.

"The president has to stand strong, and you can't fix things in a day, and that's still going, but I would expect that prices in America will be unaffected."</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Notwithstanding Lutnick's certainty, retail executives expect cost pressures to build week by week, with price increases getting much more noticeable by late June or early July. </p><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>While U.S. trade relations work through their biggest disruption in nearly a century, Lutnick and Trump are pushing a different incentive for foreign business leaders: a $5 million "gold card" that would confer permanent U.S. residency.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/trump-gold-card-lutnick" target="_blank">website</a>, trumpcard.gov, will launch within a week</li><li>"Everyone I meet who's not an American is going to want to buy the card if they have the fiscal capacity," he said.</li><li>"This is for people who can help America pay off its debt.

Title:  进击的阿里大文娱

<p style="text-align: left;">10年后，什么会成为社会的问题？</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2016年，马云曾提出过这个问题，并给出了自己的答案：Double H（健康和快乐）。彼时，阿里斥资超过500亿元，围绕“快乐”构建起庞大的版图，这就是阿里大文娱的雏形。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">如今，在成立9年后，阿里大文娱决定来一次“改头换面”。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5月21日，阿里大文娱集团正式更名为虎鲸文娱集团，旗下阿里影业更名为大麦娱乐，未来虎鲸文娱将以优酷和大麦娱乐为核心引擎，为用户创造快乐。知情人士对华尔街见闻表示，虽然阿里大文娱的任务和愿景没有变，但公司的发展节奏显然不一样了。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">这不是一次简单的品牌升级，更是阿里大文娱求变的信号。发布会上，优酷首席运营官、阿里鱼总裁吴倩表示，“新名字的背后是虎鲸文娱以归零的心态、以创业者的姿态，开启新的征程。”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">作为阿里集团从电商跨向多元化战略的重要标志，阿里大文娱成立于2016年。彼时，阿里将优酷、阿里影业、阿里音乐、阿里文学等业务统一整合进文娱板块，全面布局“快乐”产业。2023年，在阿里集团一拆六的过程中，大文娱被确定为六大业务集团之一，走向独立发展之路。5月15日，阿里发布2025财年第四季度业绩公告，阿里大文娱实现经调整EBITA盈利3600万元，实现扭亏为盈。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">站在盈利的新起点上，阿里大文娱打算闯出一番新天地。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“ 未来，我们会坚定‘内容+科技’双轮驱动战略，为用户提供线上、线下全场景娱乐体验。”吴倩表示，大文娱名字虽变，业务战略不移，未来将以AI和科技为抓手，让文娱行业良性发展，打造一艘穿越周期的文娱诺亚方舟。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">然而，不断涌现的内容形式叠加快速迭代的AI技术，对文娱行业提出了更高的要求，阿里大文娱要想做出更大的成绩，还需要拿出真本事。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">求变</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">无论是名字还是对外形象，阿里大文娱正在以全新面貌示人。阿里的动物园家族，从此多了一个虎鲸。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">一位阿里内部人士对华尔街见闻表示，虎鲸身形庞大但灵活聪明，能适应各种复杂环境，是典型的群居动物，而且拥有丰沛的情感，对人非常友好，选择虎鲸很契合大文娱所追求的理念。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">吴倩表示，文娱行业内容投资大，制作周期长，如何穿越周期，不仅考验对消费者需求的洞察，更考验通过精细化运营对投入和产出的平衡。她希望，以AI技术为抓手，实现降本增效，打造一个数智、共生、快乐的文娱生态。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">所谓“数智”，是致力于让AI真正融入文娱行业的血脉，建设一个AI时代的全新娱乐版图。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">上述知情人士表示，阿里大文娱内部，从内容生产端和体验服务端都进行了AI驱动的尝试，AI也已出现在各类使用场景中，比如，AI辅助生成数字资产，AI辅助提升虚拟拍摄虚实校准效率，AI辅助提升超高清内容的制作效率等。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据吴倩介绍，在虚拟拍摄领域，阿里大文娱已经在多个城市落地帧享数字影棚，深度支持了多部S级剧集和院线电影的拍摄；此外，公司还为片方打造了宣发服务平台灯塔，为合作伙伴节省了20%以上的宣发预算。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3月，知识产权分析机构IPRdaily发布《全球虚拟拍摄技术发明专利排行榜（TOP 30）》，来自中国的相关专利申请占比52%，优酷以80件虚拟拍摄发明专利位列全球榜首。同期，阿里大文娱发布了虚拟拍摄解决方案5.0版本，可大幅提升影视制作效率。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“共生”指的是构建影视工业化体系，与行业共享成果。目前还处于影视工业化时代的初期，华尔街见闻获悉，阿里大文娱的虚拟拍摄从2D的车窗楼景到3D的沉浸式视效，再到如今的实时特效生成，已进入良性发展模式。至于“快乐”，这是阿里大文娱的使命，要让大家从娱乐消费中获得快乐。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">数智、共生、快乐这三个关键词背后，阿里大文娱意在抓住技术变革期，迈上一个新台阶。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">阿里大文娱的底气在于，公司在头部内容生产、技术基础设施布局、人才合作培养等方面均取得阶段性成果。 比如，在优酷剧集层面，《沙尘暴》豆瓣开分8.1，刷新了今年悬疑剧最高分，《边水往事》《雪迷宫》《新生》等也是口碑佳片。阿里影业参与出品的《好东西》口碑颇佳，《流浪地球2》《长安三万里》等在海内外引发了广泛关注。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">值得关注的还有人才培养。阿里大文娱近年来吸纳了很多新锐导演，比如，电影《孤注一掷》导演申奥和优酷合作了高口碑剧《新生》，包括《边水往事》导演算、“唐探”系列编剧刘吾驷、《哪吒2》联合动画导演郝姗等在内的专业人才纷纷入职阿里大文娱。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">阿里大文娱为新人提供平台和机会，其发起的“春苗编剧计划”“海纳国际青年导演发展计划”也在为未来储备人才。华尔街见闻获悉，近五年来，已有294位编剧、38位导演的剧集处女作在优酷播出。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">不过，挑战也不容小觑。近年来，以短视频、微短剧为代表的内容持续抢占用户的时间，尤其是微短剧迅速崛起，其市场规模已经追上电影行业。更重要的是，微短剧所代表的商业模式效率更高，已经对传统影视行业造成威胁，阿里大文娱也需要破局。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">AI带来机遇的同时，也暗含风险。虽然背靠阿里这棵大树，阿里大文娱具备AI技术优势，但爱奇艺、腾讯、红果短剧等平台背后同样是百度、腾讯、字节等深度布局AI的科技大厂，这会是一场融合AI技术和影视专业的综合考验。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">尤其，阿里大文娱的造血能力仍需提高。网经社电子商务研究中心数字生活分析师陈礼腾表示，阿里大文娱整体盈利能力仍存在不确定性，需警惕内容投入与回报的不确定性、AI技术商业化落地压力、成本控制与内容质量的平衡等挑战。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">对阿里大文娱来说，是时候来一场改变，搅动本已固化的文娱行业格局，并从中寻找更好的创新机会。</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">出击</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">作为阿里大文娱双引擎之一，阿里影业也同步迎来品牌升级。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">发布会上，阿里影业总裁李捷宣布，阿里影业正式更名为大麦娱乐，公司还做了全新的片头动画厂标，未来将出现在每一部电影上。阿里影业旗下子公司大麦客户端也同步迎来更新。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">华尔街见闻从大文娱内部获悉，过去几年公司业务版图的不断扩充，“影业”已经不能涵盖公司全部的业务场景，公司除了电影，还有演出、商业衍生、剧集、艺人经纪等多个业务板块，更名更符合公司未来多元化发展的需求。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">改名也是战略升级的体现，发布会上，阿里影业首次喊出，将努力成为亚洲领先的、具有科技基因的现实娱乐（Real-life Experience）公司。现实娱乐是一种区别于数字化、碎片化、虚拟化等数字娱乐方式的现场娱乐方式，更强调现场体验、互动体验和沉浸体验。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">上述知情人士表示，娱乐和AI将成为阿里影业发展的两大战略关键词，这也是将“娱乐”放进新名称的考量，未来，阿里影业将更强调内容的原创力和对娱乐IP的打造，目标是打造具有科技基因的现实娱乐平台。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“掌握原创能力才能真正把握未来，将用3到5年的时间成为亚洲领先的内容原创公司。”李捷表示，接下来将通过7大内容厂牌、超20个工作室的内容生态集群、“海纳国际青年导演发展计划”等，让更多好故事得以涌现。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">娱乐IP方面，李捷透露，阿里影业将在电影、演出、剧集三大内容业务领域全面推出更具影响力的娱乐IP。2025年开始，公司将继续推出多类型优质电影，以及舞美互动效果一流的现场演出。“我们要向世界顶级的头部娱乐公司看齐，创作更多属于我们的原创故事系列。”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">在商业衍生方面，阿里影业旗下的阿里鱼已成长为国内头部的IP运营管理及商业化开发平台，为三丽鸥家族、宝可梦等200多个全球顶级IP服务。艺人经纪方面，公司各类型签约、合作艺人已超过百位。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">整体来看，强调现场、互动、沉浸体验的现实娱乐代表了未来的消费趋势，然而，围绕体验来做文娱生意，也注定会对服务细节提出更高要求，这会是一个不小的挑战。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">11年前，阿里影业成立，在经过多年探索后，阿里影业成为打通文娱全产业链的线下娱乐消费服务公司。如今，作为阿里大文娱的排头兵，阿里影业要开始升级打怪了。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“阿里的基因里没有守成，只有创造。”半个月前，阿里巴巴集团CEO吴泳铭发帖表示，阿里历史上颠覆性的创新，都是选择了艰难且少有人走的路。同时，AI技术革命，也让阿里多样化的产品和服务有机会产生更大协同效应，具备创造全新用户体验的机会。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">创造快乐是一件很难的事情，阿里大文娱终于要开启新副本了。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p> 

Title:  80亿美元！OnlyFans母公司洽谈出售 
Description:  <p style="text-align: left;">OnlyFans在全球疫情期间人气飙升，如今这个总部位于伦敦的内容平台可能即将迎来它的历史性转折。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">据路透社报道，洛杉矶投资公司Forest Road正在与OnlyFans公司洽谈收购事宜，对该平台的估值高达80亿美元。消息人士称，这些谈判自今年3月以来一直在进行，具体交易条款尚未披露。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">有趣的是，社交媒体上的评论者已开始将这笔交易戏称为创造了“历史上最富有的皮条客（pimp）”，暗指该平台因其“成人内容”分成模式而闻名的商业性质。</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wscnph" src="https://wpimg-wscn.awtmt.com/f6be90c3-2173-4fcb-b923-fe91b26f6803.png" data-wscntype="image" data-wscnh="211" data-wscnw="588"/></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">潜在收购方Forest Road是一家成立于2017年的投资公司，专注于媒体、数字内容、能源和生命科学领域。该公司在2024年收购了一支Formula E赛车队，同年还收购了一家精品投资银行。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>报道称，该公司部分高管曾在2022年加入一个特殊目的收购公司（SPAC），试图让OnlyFans上市</strong>，这表明双方的联系由来已久。报道称，OnlyFans可能也在与其他潜在买家接触。</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">摆脱“成人内容”标签，OnlyFans致力转型</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">全球疫情居家时期，内容经济蓬勃发展。OnlyFans也正是在那时抓住流量密码，粉丝用户数据持续飙升。当时OnlyFans用户数月均增速达47%，单日最高新增创作者破5万。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">不过，该平台出名的方式一直颇受争议。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">OnlyFans自2018年被亿万富翁Leonid Radvinsky收购以来，一直在努力摆脱其与色情和成人内容相关的声誉。</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">近年来，平台积极扩大其创作者阵容，增加喜剧演员、厨师和个人健身教练等非成人内容创作者，旨在吸引更广泛的用户群体并向主流市场转型。</p>
<p>这一战略似乎正在取得成效。根据母公司Fenix International今年9月的报告，OnlyFans在截至2023年11月30日的财年中，利润增长20%至约4.855亿美元。</p><p>本文来自华尔街见闻，欢迎下载APP查看更多</p>
